No dia em que os homens deixar de avaliar sentimentos em bolsa entraremos no mesmo saco... O dinheiro serve, a alguns nunca chegam, a outros basta ter suficiente, e há aqueles que muitos se tiver usa, se não  tiver nada muda, o pouco chega o muito resta... Muitos por dinheiro vendem a alma e falsificam o espírito, e podem tentar enganar os seus similares, mas não  aos que estão por cima de nós... com dinheiro ou sem dinheiro um copo de água e um pedaço  de pão nunca faltam aos que acreditem que ser gente é não há  preço, que Deus existe para todos e que ele conhece cada 1 de nós por dentro. O amor não se constrói e nem se quantifica em base ao dinheiro e etc,  mas em base ao que o coração doa e não há dinheiro que o pode fazer brilhar o centro do teu coração.... tristes daqueles que só  pensam em dinheiro e quando morrem, morrem sem amor. Mestre o teu coração avalia... Você  sabe que existe muitas formas de fazer dinhtiro, mas a que serve? Viver sem amor? mas não é importante e nem me interessa... se não tiver um abraço sincero e um sorriso com lealdade. Por isso que se diz, amém a si mesmos, isto significa e é para não  avaliar os outros da mesma forma sem amor...",Ines Gonçalves,0,2022-05-08T05:15:22Z

278,UgxMJFKz1pCEBt9cDil4AaABAg,"Selfish People Can’t Produce Unselfish Solutions

In Europe and elsewhere, governments are paying colossal sums to big corporations to help them avert bankruptcy. Whether they call it a “rescue package” or “quantitative easing,” in the end it’s all the same: the government pays companies to stay operative.
I don’t think it will work in the long run. It may keep companies afloat for another six months or a year, but as a rule, a government, any government, cannot sustain companies that cannot sustain themselves. In the end, the situation will blow up in a blast that will be worse than what it would have happened had the government let them fall naturally.
There is more to it than that. I don’t believe that a government can do anything good for its people. Civil servants, ministers, and deputy ministers always pull their own way and have their own interests in mind. Since everyone is inherently selfish, everyone has an ulterior motive that is not for the benefit of the public.
We cannot expect selfish people to do unselfish acts; it is like asking a tiger to become vegetarian. If it goes against nature and it won’t work. Therefore, asking people whose only focus is their own career to focus on other people’s well-being is unwise, unrealistic, and will invariably fail.
Socialists, capitalists, far right, or far left, they are all immersed in egoism. It is not their fault; it is human nature, and we should adjust our expectation from our leaders.
If we want a real and lasting positive change, we must transform human nature. Since our nature is selfish to the core, changing it is the only way out of the crises that the world is falling into nowadays. We will fall deeper and deeper until we realize that the problem is not the fuel we burn, the forests we cut, the water we pollute, or the people we kill. The problem is the cause of all those harms we are inflicting on nature and on each other: our inherent self-absorption. When we start working on changing ourselves rather than demanding everything and everyone else to change, we might be able to save ourselves before it is too late..",roni bark,0,2022-03-02T15:08:04Z

I came from grade school and would turn on the TV to dance to the music and really enjoyed it. One day I would go to my mother to show her the song I had found that I was always dancing to. She said ""This is George Harrison."" and I said ""I really like the song he sings. I like him too because of it. He must be a great person."" My mom then said ""Honey, George Harrison doesn't live anymore."" And for no other reason but it dawning on me that someone who's made me happy with his song for many weeks wasn't alive anymore , I burst into the biggest tears I'd never cried before. Will never forget that feeling of deep deep sadness. RIP George ❤️",Hanji Koch,11,2021-10-19T05:28:04Z

Just thought this very cool song needed some new lyrics

I got my mind set on God
I got my mind set on God 

I got my mind set on God 

I got my mind set on God

But it's gonna take faith
A whole lotta precious faith
It's gonna take lots of faith
To do it right child

It's gonna take grace
A whole lot of precious grace
It's gonna take patience and grace, ummm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right child

I got my mind set on God
I got my mind set on God
I got my mind set on God
I got my mind set on God

And this time I know it's for real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it

I got my mind set on God
Set on God
I got my mind set on God
Set on God

But it's gonna take faith
A whole lotta precious faith
It's gonna take lots of faith
To do it right child

It's gonna take grace
A whole lot of precious grace
It's gonna take patience and grace, ummm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right child

I got my mind set on God
I got my mind set on God
I got my mind set on God
I got my mind set on God

And this time I know it's for real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it

But it's gonna take faith
A whole lotta precious faith
It's gonna take lots of faith
To do it right child

It's gonna take grace
A whole lot of precious grace
It's gonna take patience and grace, ummm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right child

Set on God
Set on God

The corporate purposes was STOP GARDEN HEAVEN. The day after the Lockerbie bombing of that airliner by Libya, I added fight terrorism in all it's forms. Too bad the Clinton's didn't take that seriously 😳. 
    So here we are. The whole world STOPPED. 
    Now our focus must be GARDEN!
    We just learned that we can get the essential work done very efficiently. And we can get it even more efficient. 
     Then we transition our economy to green sustainable leisure time activities!!! Or GARDEN.
    But we will only get that if we all stand up and DEMAND IT!

The trouble was, they were filming a scene for Wallstreet down the hall, and Michael Douglas and his friends kept chasing us, I thought we were in A Hard Day's Night all over again. But once we signed some autographs, Ringo and I were back to practice and we nailed it. Ringo was great, very professional. He kept saying, 'Remember George, there'll be a rhino and a warthog and a white bird in a cage vying for your spot, so you need to outshine them all. And don't shave. All the lads are doing that now, like the guy from Wham! for example. So I was really comfortable with the dance routine.""

2310,UgwDfTlt1P_InAp5Q914AaABAg,"さっきの続き　この曲を聴いてた当時の事が非常になつかしかったから、当時のことをかいてみよう！
高校時代、部活に専念するため親元を離れて下宿してた頃、わざと部屋にテレビを置かないでラジオと読書、映画を見に行くことで好奇心を満たしてた。　北海道函館市は当然のことながら冬雪が降ってとっても寒く、大学進学のための勉強、未来への人生への不安で、自分のなかでは、一番辛い時期だったかもしれないなあ。高2の冬、毎日朝1時間早く起きて、海の浜辺までランニングをしに行って、部屋まで帰ってきたら、硬式野球部だったんで素振りをして学校に行った。これを約3ヶ月半は繰り返したかなあ。
そのかいあって、高3、夏の最後の公式戦で弱小野球部だったが、11年ぶりに南北海道大会に出場した。(ランニングは、エースピッチャーとして重責を担っていたので毎試合9回を連日投げるスタミナを付けるためにおこなったこと)  1回戦で東海大四高と当たり、自分のノーコン病がまた発生して11対4で負けたが、相手の左のエースからカーブをライトスタンドギリギリだがホームランを打った。すっぽ抜けて肩口から落ちてくるションベンカーブだった。中学時代、函館予選の郡部の決勝で、ピッチャーでドラフト1位指名でベイスターズに入団したピッチャーと対戦してものすごくキレの良いカーブをセンターをかなり下がらせるといっても余裕で取られたけど、タイミングバッチリでバットの真芯の数ミリ上でとらえた経験があったから、東海大四の左ピッチャーのカーブは、まさにションベンカーブにしか見えなかったな。当たり前に実力で打てたホームラン。このホームランが高校時代3年間の苦しみを救ってくれたのかな、今思うと。ホントに懐かしい思い出だ。日本人でこのコメントを読む人間はほとんどいないと思うので、自慢話だけど安心して書いてみた。",松本卓二,0,2021-01-31T00:14:39Z

Jesus Christ was God manifest in the flesh and died on the cross for all our sins, was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures. He did that because he loves us and he does not want us to go to hell. Jesus said in  John 3:15-16 ""that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""

Rejoice friend! Salvation is a free gift from God :)

Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Friend, you can KNOW that you have eternal life RIGHT NOW simply by trusting in Jesus Christ alone

1 John 5:13
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved :)

The other idea of having to work for no paycheck around the clock seven months before seeing any kind of money whatsoever. My other thoughts were basically about the chair that he is sitting in. I used to sit in a very similar seat each morning before, during food and smoke breaks and after work to sit and watch television. I always sat in that same chair. The issue with this chair was not with me. It was with my TWO bosses. You see when I arrived at this cabin/farm property I had never received the history of the chair I loved so much. It wasn’t until I moved out of the cabin to go to work independently that I found the information on the history of the chair. As for the history of “the chair” it was used only for the workers on the farm. Everyone else sat in other very nice seating. So with this being said..the men that used to farm here, cut down trees and work in the sewage tanks on the property and up in the mountains hunting or what have you Wood sweat all day and be filthy never take showers and sat in this chair every day. Soooo these dude’s Wood 🤡 clown me on the low to each other and laugh behind my back about the nastiest seat I always had to sit in and it was all because the four other guys that I worked along side Wood take the other good seats every time..every day! You dum dum. I enjoyed that seat. It made me feel wonderful you idiots lol. As for the rest of your lives..try not to be so friggin greedy. Maybe things might work out for you better.

I realize that not everyone likes every song but why bother pulling up a song/video if it's one you don't like. It just seems foolish. George happens to be my favorite of the Beetles. I really like each and every one of them and collectively they had several excellent songs and as individuals they each had several great songs.

It's no joke that Hollywood stopped appreciating perfected skill and imperious practice the summer of '73. Everything raw and natural is broken down, parted out then attempts are made to synthetically reproduce that they wish to ""claim"" by deception and trickery. The jealous, spiteful hellatious creatures are akin to vampires and zombies (their practices are not any different, literally). Nothing is to be adored, appreciated or larger than life to any imbecile without his own living force. All of us, and ""it"" is for consumption and disposal now. Their survival depends upon it, actually.  Frankly, I'm mesmerized ""they"" even ""let"" you play, ""show off""! On your right, the brown house with the thieves inside. That's where I would be right now, and we would have coffee, cigarettes and share my beautiful pancakes. You are legendary, and that's to behold and treasure. Sure wish you'd ""show off"" more often. It's your soul or source of life they're after (they have none, I've checked and rechecked and then found they were not even created by our creator! Whatever made these things must be subdued). Oh, and I'm sure they marked you, (as a Marxist would) and keep you at arm's length. You're either a recipe, organ donor or worth your weight in ground meat.  No bother to anyone, I suppose. Now let's make ""real"" hit lists and play much more music and impress me once more and then again to make it historical so we can look back at now from then and be thankful the heathens are dead, I enjoyed assasinating them and they will not be coming back. We can invent again! Create! Imagine! Envision! Plan and evolve to include incomprehendable growth and beneficial effect. I'll have more coffee and (imagined, as usual) good company. I hope this finds you in good spirits, on good spirits or, hell..I just hope it finds you, then reach me, please. It is an excellent score. An instant hit, like everything you do, with your all and without fail. I admire your guts and patience. Now I want your glory! I do believe I will listen a few more times (at least). What the world needs now is more you and more instruments. You're not even playing one you made, yet. 93 to be rediscovered for your lives of dedication to the glorious love of music and not one violin by you, or anyone sane or noticable.",Margaret Murphy,1,2020-08-26T20:18:32Z

3386,Ugxxb9VTuCdasoNjjFV4AaABAg,"Ode to the romantic feeling of wine charts, , the scarlet monarchy of wineries, the Bordeaux light palace, made of purple crystal,, whose castellated garden, of aristocratic clusters of grapes, protagonizes the splendid spectacle of the ground motherhood, and highlights the suspended green gold carpets, which unfurl the royal flag of the sovereignty of wine, the magna carta of the fruit of the vine of the infallible  cycle of the seasons! Inspired by the romantic ambiance polite and gentle of posture of wine arrangements, in the telluric metaphors, from the idyllic world of wine, the scarlet monarchy of vineyards, the Burgundy Palace, whose imposing gardens with lush grapes, manifesting the magnificent spectacle of proverbial maternity of the fertile soil and the green-gold hanging carpets which display the flag of wine sovereignty,, the magna carta of the fruit of the vine the fabulous cycle of the seasons! It was untying the Gordian knot, from the tacit silence of the majestic verses of the violet soul of wine, it was untied, the gordium knot, of the silent silence, of the prodigious verses, of violet soul of wine! submerged in the unprecedented and dreamlike continent of the pelagic cellars ; designed to be kept, in the horizontality of the time wrapper; discovered by tasting flavor of the lips of palates refined in the eloquent invocation of the song of pleasure, discovered by taste through refined palates, in the wonderful invocation of the pleasure recital!  it was opened, the utopias of the idyllic cork stoppers, of the , of the allegorical depth of the wine bottles! The vine is a climber, from the blue mountain, from the imagination of rain! The bodily marriage of the twilight blood runs in the arteries of the poetic lineage of the vines, inspiring the musical works of the composers! The alphabet of tonality of all the royal shades of red, glistening melifluously, in the crystal chalice of wine, enthroned on the table, symbolizing the sharing of the bread of love, and reflecting the light of understanding! The flame of telluric inspiration, of the composition of the soil , composes the unparalleled poems of magnificent nature, to toast and crown lyricism in the dishes of national and international gastronomy! The supreme gala bouquet of the fragrance of wine has the offspring of classical poetry! The unspeakable telluric nectar of the vines, overflowing the Cups of dreams of literature!  The vine is a legitimate winner in the arena of bad weather and adversity! An exemplary paradigm of life's perseverance! The vine fully fulfills its vocation as a delicacy of the gods to the sound of angelic harps! The hierarchical poetic flavor of wine is in the noble verses of the grape, in the richness of the soil literature and in the wise constitution of authorship of the winemaker! The vines wear the rhetoric of exuberance, and ornament themselves, pompously like queens and princesses, in the summer solstice season, it is when they extend the carpet of royal colors, and the vestments, and purple covers of royalty to the light of the matured and seasoned resplendent flame; in the light of the ruby jasper scepter, the full ripening of the delight of the sublime fruit nectar! The vine leaf is the map of the country of wine, a non-transferable destination for the voluptuous adventures of literature! Is it the vine that inspires the bear or the bear that inspires the vine, in the fairy tale of hibernal sleep? The sacrosanct vintage of the raceme of the poetry of the vine celebrate the exuberant idylls of the marriage of the fertile soil with the romantic vineyards in the light of the sun's sonnets of love! The harvest of the lyrical sonnets, the poetry of the literary composition of the grape, culminates in the declamation, of the succulent delights of the mill of the fantasies of the feet! ! Wine is the panacea for the arterial verses of the heart! The supreme gala bouquet of the wine fragrance has the lineage of erudite poetry! The bohemian, the wine, the silver tear shines on the rapier ,  and the poetry, duel undaunted in the light of the moon, for the colloquial and erudite love of the blue princess! The Blue Princess is the delight of the auriculas of the heart of the man of poetry! The Blue Princess has a personality that is distinguished due to her firmness of character! The Man of Words is a Sommelier of the ethereal wines of the afterglow, the sunset wine, bottled in the heavenly inspiration! The Sommelier is a polyglot, from the lyric letters of the languages ​​of the wines! The amaranth rose, the crimson flower, withs scintillation petals, spices the wine sauce, sprinkled on it, the crne of the cream, of the poetry! I am a surviving shipwreck of heavy rain of the ethyl storms, thanks to the merciful hand of my creator!@@@ ZZZ",daniel oliveira,0,2020-06-11T04:22:15Z

The eternal country of childhood, is the magical homeland of fable, and unforgettable fantasy! The pandorga, with poetic silk sticks, the kite of Chinese characters was the spaceship, of the pranky lyricism of adventures! The child loves the sky heaven  in his perfect world! The poetic woman is the likeness, the paradoxical fragility and tenderness, the design, the verses of the weapon, the warlike and belligerent ode of female anatomy! The look of his cut, corporal is a spiritual curvature, sharper, and more cutting, than the Katana Sword, forged in the process, of the glowing furnace and and of the clay vase, and rice paper of the inspired verses, made from the magma of mineral sand abyssal, planned, in hard and detailed and detailed work! The butt and of stock of feminine gun,lightness fits perfectly in the male shoulder of the literary composition! Who can escape from its infrared crosshairs! Who can escape, from instant reading, from your  aiming ?  The poetic moon of my youth, shines in the sky of my heart, but the shining sun, is the compass that illuminates, the verses of the composition of the stanzas of my immortal soul! The Art without feeling is the ecatomb of the idyllic lyricism of poetry! Truth is a poetic woman, who is loved or hated! The pimp bird , of the metaphorical mists, of the allegories, riot, fantasy noise! Happiness is fleeting, when feelings are translucent! Love, is the primordial word, which sums up the meaning of life @@@ ZZZ",Daniel Oliveira,0,2020-01-18T23:13:07Z

I did suspect that he wasn't doing the dance moves in this video--and I just checked up on a couple of sources that there INDEED was a stunt double. Additionally, the reason for this version two video was that apparently people complained that in the first version, people didn't see George in it. George was flattered; hence the reason for his making this video. I certainly was glad he made this version for the same reason. This version is way more lively which I think fits better with the song.",GlamGal 710,3,2019-08-28T13:07:45Z

But we know what they're really about. They're really white supremacists who believe that the inclusion of brown people means the destruction of society.

A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, um
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right


I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you


And this time I know it's for real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it


But it's gonna take money
A whole lot of spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right, child


It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, um
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right


Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
Set on you
I set my mind on you
I'm gonna set on you",Antonio Usai,211,2019-04-02T06:06:33Z

Couldn't think of any lyrics
No I never wrote the lyrics
So I'll just sing any old lyrics
That come to mind, child

You really need words
Whole lotta rhyming words
You gotta rhyme so many words, mm-mm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, to do it right, child

This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long

I know that you're probably sore
'Cause I didn't write any more
I just didn't get to complete it
So that's why I gotta repeat it

This song is just six words long (six words long)
This song is just six words long (six words long)

Oh I make a lotta money
They pay me a ton of money
They're payin' me plenty of money
To sing this song, child

I gotta fill time
Three minutes worth of time
Oh, how will I fill so much time, mm-mm
I'll throw in a solo, a solo, a solo
A solo, a solo here

This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long

This song's got nothin' to say
But I'm recording it anyway
I know if I put my mind to it
I know I could find a good rhyme here

Oh, you gotta have-a music
You need really catchy music
This song has got plenty of music
But just six words, child

And so I'll sing' em over
And over and over and over
And over and over and over, mm-mm
And over and over and over
And over and over and over again

I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

And this time I know it's for real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it

I got my mind set on you
Set on you
I got my mind set on you
Set on you

But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, ummm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it,
To do it right child

I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you
I got my mind set on you

And this time I know it's for real
The feelings that I feel
I know if I put my mind to it
I know that I really can do it

But it's gonna take money
A whole lotta spending money
It's gonna take plenty of money
To do it right child

It's gonna take time
A whole lot of precious time
It's gonna take patience and time, ummm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it,
To do it right

Set on you
Set on you

One day this guy had a Knick at the door. There was another guy who wanted a guitar to practice on. Now the main character had a good guitar which he showed to the guy at the door. He wanted £70 for it. The guy at the door didn't have that much money to spend! He had £50 though so that's what he gave him. The main character accepted this money . Guess who the guy at the door was? George Harrison. I'm not even kidding! George Harrison got his first guitar from someone I knew!,ii_jxedxmxe_ii,5,2017-05-20T08:42:28Z
