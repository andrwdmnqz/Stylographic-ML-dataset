239,UgyudB3a5n5mXhcXJZt4AaABAg,Geoffrey Logsdon,"Yes, George was the first rock musician to stage a large scale concert for purely humanitarian reasons. It is a shame that Allen Klein was too stupid or lazy to register the concert as a tax-exempt venture, and l would imagine he managed to steal a lot of the money for himself. After all of George's efforts and the other musicians efforts, AND the album sales, l think a paltry million pounds went to Bangladesh. 
BUT, kudos to Harry Chapin for bringing the awareness of hunger to the world's attention (although, Harry didn't want ANYONE to be hungry, including Americans, a view understandably not shared by anyone else). Anyway, Harry lit George's and Bob Geldof's fire and the rest is history. Why is Mick fucking Jagger a knight, and George isn't? Oh...not a good Catholic boy like Mick. And Elton John is a knight too?  And not George?? Ugh.",2021-10-12T00:56:48Z,0

This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
Couldn't think of any lyrics
No I never wrote the lyrics
So I'll just sing any old lyrics
That come to mind, child
You really need words
Whole lotta rhyming words
You gotta rhyme so many words, mm-mm
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it, to do it right, child
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
I know that you're probably sore
'Cause I didn't write any more
I just didn't get to complete it
So that's why I gotta repeat it
This song is just six words long (six words long)
This song is just six words long (six words long)
Oh I make a lotta money
They pay me a ton of money
They're payin' me plenty of money
To sing this song, child
I gotta fill time
Three minutes worth of time
Oh, how will I fill so much time, mm-mm
I'll throw in a solo, a solo, a solo
A solo, a solo here
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song's got nothin' to say
But I'm recording it anyway
I know if I put my mind to it
I know I could find a good rhyme here
Oh, you gotta have-a music
You need really catchy music
This song has got plenty of music
But just six words, child
And so I'll sing' em over
And over and over and over
And over and over and over, mm-mm
And over and over and over
And over and over and over again
Six words long, six words long
Six words long, six words long
Six words long, six words long
This song is just six words long
It's just six words long

It covered quite a bit of info, but altogether I can sit with a good pen and make something more finished for you. Norway, at C8, I need assistance please. Getting interception from Gerald, P Greece in Germany under Dale""s guard. Ben, L London in  USA under Dave's guard. Delvin, P Broadway in Missouri under Benson. They are all hardwired through the intestine. This is the third century that we have been without our Naval Academies. Usually, we are born at sea.  (born means ""from the sea""). We are either delivered to the ocean straight from the womb be and we are greeted by all the ocean life and the woman who held us in her womb goes back to service immediately after. We have a family of a different sort than the people who have been killing us, taking over government and military affairs, stole our houses, businesses, children, supplies , ECT. These people stole great big houses while we were in duty. They refuse to enter the military, they think we were put here to be their help and they are currently running things because the property address that they be squat at belongs to someone we know and trust. We assume when that specific house makes a decision it can be trusted. A lot of their steem comes from the house that the next legion assigned to clear housing will find. In 1942 all of our housing was clear. It took very little time but we had/have some major problems. They killed SS guards and stole uniforms to escape camps. Now (for the last 9 generations) they have successfully found four ways to get a ""new"" body from our tombs, where we were put to rest because the ME wasn't able to wake us, but knew we lived. They robbed and dedicated our tombs. They make gasoline out of squashed living life's liquid source. It takes 12 million sleeping bodies to make a tank of jet fuel, yet NO engine runs on gas. They are just trying to erase someone from history and time. If you seal the gas tank and use the air type like what lighter fuel comes in, it would take two teaspoons and last six months. Make the tank airtight and install a fill hole where the pump used to go. I would use a liquid sealant after removing the tank and install a lighter filling port on my gas cap. I made the Cadillac converter too to bypass fuel and they gave the wrong instructions to the manufacturers and they are hooked up wrong. Vehicles will run much better on air filled fuel than they do on liquid gas. We've made so many engines that don't need our life or other animals or plants lives to support them. The axis found some supply with our technology and immediately destroyed it. Everything in every store or for sale anywhere was first made by us in the Navy. All the work (things we do that we don't like doing) that we would ever need to do, for ever, we completed with our first four lines in under 15  minutes. The axis has pilfered about 20% they break our vehicles, poison and deficate in our food, break and refabricate goods that we don't like, need or want. Gone are the days of prototypes and blueprints. They just do whatever they want and we suffer their stupidity. Example: some chick (Illuminati part 1, we are on part 4 now) made her signature on a piece of paper and it made it to the City into planning and development. She was a squatter living in a house that belonged to someone rightous, because of the reputation of the land/property owner (which doesn't change, houses are not bought or sold you must earn land rights by following law and order to gain or advance on planet A. You must pass being able to adapt to planet A because the planets we aspire to inhabit along with Earth have much more stringency. This is the most accepting and tolerable planet we've got. If you can't follow Earth's systematic structure without losing your shit for not getting your way, feel comfortable and entitled  changing into someone else's body to avoid justice, wear organs stolen from the tomb of people you pretend to be in order to get things done, chances are you won't be part of the future of our solar system or responsible for naming anything gross ever again. So the signature, it's out off the highway about six miles. It takes nine days to drive from beginning to end and it's only six miles long. If I got stuck on that road I would kill someone.",2020-08-27T02:10:48Z,0

Es una humilde sugerencia y esperemos que alguien m√°s nos de una recomendaci√≥n m√°s. Saludos.",2017-03-16T15:48:28Z,5

Para que la buena m√∫sica llegue a las nuevas generaciones, simple, eso es trabajo de cada persona, as√≠ no escuchar√°n cosas como, bueno, me enferma solo de escribir lo, perreo, regueton, narcocorridos, o m√∫sica pop-fresa con letra demasiado mala.

Yo crec√≠ con unos padres ignorantes, pero que crees, tom√© la decisi√≥n de encontrar verdadera m√∫sica, apesar de lo que llegaron a escuchar en mi casa.

Hasta me encanta la m√∫sica cl√°sica.

Soy joven a√∫n, no creas que soy un se√±or, solo por tener esos gustos, pero se reconocer m√∫sica refinada, m√∫sicos talentosos y que te lleva a otra forma de ver la vida, gracias a la naturaleza y nadie m√°s.

Por cierto, ese caf√© es de los peores.
