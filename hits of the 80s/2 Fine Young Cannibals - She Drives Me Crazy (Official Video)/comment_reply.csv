I'm no specialist but while looking this band up on Youtube, I found what seems to be a recent 80s night where he sang live, although I'm not super fan of super minimalistic singing styles, I'll give it to him that he sang perfectly on the right notes, unlike many, many ""better"" famous singers when they're live, but of course usually it'd be a lot more complex singing plus add the physical performance factors etc... anyway, if you'd like to listen to the updated original (no idea if the musicians are thesame, probably not) here's the live: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT04OpSO_n4",2020-12-28T07:28:33Z,0
