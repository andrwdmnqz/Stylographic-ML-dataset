(""no."")

-----

if you really (actually [beyond egos]) want to close a divide:

the iceberg that sank the titanic (in 1997):

i've got to finish the why between emphasis and meaning (because of implications)

-----

don't worry about it because it contradicts regards for consideration, bothersomely (unless hopelessly given up or given in to helplessness and overwhelmed by exhaustion to even be frustrated about being treated unfairly or being inadequate to not be helpless or ungrateful.)(find a new reason to enable yourself to do more.)

sometimes people urge people to see how they'd tick so that they could leech off of them or leech their energy. beyond that, they're a total circus act.
-----
like they push people off their guard or knock people off their center by suprising them with unfocused on regards to elaborate regarding their regards and probably to elaborate reacting or interacting as though like (to be involved and, or just or, figured like.)

------

investing:

buy when they can't sell no more (to not upset the recurring activity, activity rhythm or rhythm) and sell when they can't buy no more (based on recent and regular amounts [and types {figuring the accumulating sums to figure potential encouragement for selling or buying} - to understand the range of confidence about monetary involvement with the stock] of activity)

----
----

justification delusions are worrying way into blaming one'sself because of exhaustion to say, ""no, it's something else,"" overwhelmedly or overwhelmingly.

-----
-----

like they (or regards[?]) exhaust people with their potentially frustrating (or avoidance encouraging misunderstanding their capabilities [for elaborating their own considerations] and dissuasions or inadequacies imposed by and because of their) persistence to make them agree with them (and if the elaboration of regards for regarding doesn't seem encouraging of and for [or of, for and about] their involvement, then they'd either criticize because of being overwhelmed [for concurring support for encouragement or exhaustion to disregard,] they'd be helpless but to hopelessly concur [because of not elaborating regards for encouraging regarding] or they'd be frustrated because of the hopes for finding relief by reenacting, or expressing about, the involvement unfulfilled about to understand to know better enough to be thrilled, unless just thrilled, by not elaborating enduring.)

(make compromises to both be happy to be considerate of enabling considerations and not concerns - i'm done with the religious ""deciding"" to disrespect me [by not considering me by and because of justifying bothers which elaborated my concerns, which i'd feel bothered about.])

I can't stop
The way I feel
Things you do
Don't seem real
Tell you what you've got in mind
'Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get
Any rest
People say
I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I won't make it
On my own
No on likes
To be alone

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

Uh huh huh

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

Uh huh huh

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself",Nico Bocco,0,2021-07-08T23:07:30Z

I specifically remember buying this cassette single in a neighborhood store because a high school friend from senor year was working at that store part time. As I was taking the cassette single to the front of the store to pay for it this friend stopped me and asked me what I was buying.

Things go wrong, they always do

8 But what does it say? ""The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ""Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame."" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.",Ricky 77333,0,2020-09-14T07:09:46Z

Things, places, and people that were key parts of my life, that I thought I would never forget. It suddenly dawned on me that it's faded. You're so used to something and then suddenly 10/15/20/+ years have passed and you don't even know you've forgotten it unless you see or hear it again.

Yes, I saw him, but less prominently in 2016 or 2017, when I played the song a few times with not much thought of it. The name Fine Young Cannibals, has a different twist on it than it did in 1989. Probably my 30 years of sailing ‚õµÔ∏è through the changes. Same sound to the song and the group name, as to then, and yet not. I love all these songs.",Jeffrey Hickman,12,2020-05-19T01:37:19Z

Thoughts and everything are different as to then. Seem to be going through a phase that I‚Äôm playing this song almost endlessly since I moved out of my apartment and am temporarily living at my brother‚Äôs house. Something is so interesting about it, and my 30 years of thoughts and memories , plus those then. I think this is half the reason I like this song. It‚Äôs like a ‚ÄúThen And Now‚Äù, or ‚Äú30 years Later‚Äù song. The other half is one ‚òùÔ∏è feeling my body seems to keep feeling since I threw away my thyroid medication for a simple fix I found out on YouTube.  This song explains what that feeling is, along with being twenty pounds skinnier and full of energy. Not groggy or sapped energy. All in the last couple weeks, this song hits #1 on my own top charts. Thank God for IPhones, since you can customize your own arrangement of songs. No waiting for sheer luck as to when the radio‚Äôs going to play it. Can create a 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs oldies like night. Sock hops and Doo Wop fun as well, as if going back to the time of these songs. Keep these great üëç songs coming. Even songs from 1989 to now are of interest. There‚Äôs also something interesting with Neil Young‚Äôs ‚ÄúOld Man‚Äù, heard on a wooden Crosley cathedral shaped radio I received for Christmas üéÑ of 1988. It had a lighted dial and black numbers for AM and FM. Like taking a trip back in time to 1972. A song which was only 16 years old in 1988, is now 48 years old in 2020. Man, where has the time gone!! Graduation üë©‚Äçüéì and all the memories. We will like these songs forever. I was 19 when I graduated in 1989. Hard to believe I‚Äôm turning 50 in June. Hard for my parents too, which live in Alaska. Came here to Arizona to live with my mom and stepfather. That was my graduation üë©‚Äçüéì present I was hoping to pursue when I was just 8. These songs will live forever in our thoughts, actions, memories and so on. Love üíï ‚Äúem all. They‚Äôre also decent and simple sing alongs of our childhood.",Jeffrey Hickman,0,2020-05-19T01:21:39Z

3605,UgxHTLSY-x8uRL46MpF4AaABAg,"I think the 1980's, as a time period in music history, faded away on the heels of this single and this album.  I don't think it is unfair to say that this single was the last true 1980's single, The Raw and the Cooked was the last true 1980's hit album, making the Fine Young Cannibals the last true 1980's act.  All the innovations and characteristics of the 1980's sound can be found in this single: the use of digital tools to create rhythm and interest, highly stylized and refined vocals, and precisely timed syncopation between the elements.  It is as if the whole of the 1980's was refined and coalesced into THIS single, to the point that, once heard, there was nowhere else for the 1980's to go.  From this time forward, the things that made this single work were no longer RAW, but COOKED, and the new rawness came from abandoning the things that made this single work (an abandonment of digital tools, an abandonment of polished vocals, and an abandonment of clean syncopation).  Enter grunge and alternative, with one last swan song to remember the 80's by.",Adam Yoksas,3,2020-02-10T17:20:49Z

I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
'Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me

She drives me crazy, like no one else
She drives me crazy, and I can't help myself

I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me that's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy, like no one else
She drives me crazy, and I can't help myself

I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

She drives me crazy, like no one else
She drives me crazy, and I can't help myself

She drives me crazy, like no one else
She drives me crazy, and I can't help myself

She drives me crazy, like no one else

            [Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

[Verse 3]
I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

[Chorus]
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself",alishahid292,0,2019-06-03T01:16:49Z

Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind

Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drive me crazy and I can't help myself
I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me that's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drive me crazy and I can't help myself
I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be a lone
She drives me crazy like no one else

5204,UgyorIslBik8t3yep2B4AaABAg,"""this was in the late 80's
1989 to be exact, I was
24 and I'm 54 now
back then I was into both
New Wave and Hard Rock
go figure....
I lived in a small Oklahoma town
and I still do,
where getting these genres of music
was overshadowed by country,disco
& top 40 hits,
if the radio stations didn't play it
and the music stores didn't sell it
you didn't have a chance getting it....
then along came MTV not perfect
but made it able to see good music
for a change,they showed some 
great videos by some great artists
they also played some 
crappy videos here and there,
then all of sudden people complained
their music videos weren't being shown
then the MTV as we knew it no longer existed
it was now Rap TV because the rappers
wanted their way and got it,
then along came the Crap Years with 
Beyonce,
Maria Carey,
Britney Spears,
Justin Timberlake,
Jennifer Lopez
and the other jerks who 
were told that they could sing,
as time went by it was now nothing
but reality shows and still is,
but now with You Tube you can weed 
out the Crap and watch what you 
want again Rock,New Wave,music from 
other countries,artists you couldn't get back then....
Uhhhh,Sorry I get carried away when I
remember the past both good and bad,
thanks for the good memories.""-‚ò∫üìªüé∂.

Give me thumbs up to avoid others can get it with ""open door"" questions each year, to be the first asking, avoid asking confirmation people watch it every single year passed. 

It is better to do it for decades because it belongs to decades, exists for decades and taste doesn't change. It is just what you prefer and views and likes confirms it, no need to ask for opinions.
