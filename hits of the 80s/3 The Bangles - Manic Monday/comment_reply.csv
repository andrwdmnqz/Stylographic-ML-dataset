29,Ugy1nKpw--qMMzRmwBp4AaABAg,Osayawe Agbontaen,"You bringing up that fact is making think, and look at this song I love in a completely different way because Prince was a Satanist.  There is definitely a Satanic or hidden meaning behind this song, which goes deeper than just a song about 9 to 5 blues. Sunday would be a fun day to a Satanist because they worship the Sun God. Even the classic line ""Of all my nights/Why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?"" could have a deeper meaning too. He could literally be talking about the Devil himself or Demons that come out at night to play.",2022-02-10T05:05:16Z,1

It turns out Manic Monday was one of the two original songs Prince sent to the Bangles to record after seeing an early Bangles show in Los Angeles.  He just knew they could turn one of his original songs into a masterpiece.

  Prince's gift to Susannah catapulted them into

  girls in England who performed 'Eternal Flame', called
  Atomic Kitten , but they only sang (no instruments). 
  They had a lengthy career and were commended on
  their performance by Susannah herself when the song
  came out 12 years after The Bangles. Since Susannah
  was part of the writing team, I'm sure she realized strong
  residuals since it did place high on the charts in England.

360,UgzSEd5OANVlPXbyn6t4AaABAg,GrilloTheFlightless,"Cathy Cummins For me it was a lot more bizarre.

I was born in the late 70s and loved the music of the 50s & 60s, went through the 80s without any interest in the music of the era, hated the music of the late 80s but by that time loved the 70s. I got very bored with the 90s so stuck to the 60s & 70s, but by the late 90s started to love a lot of music from the 20s and 30s. At the same time I got heavily into traditional British music, including songs that were hundreds of years old. Then, in the 2010s, I started to remember all the music that was in the background during the 80s when I was growing up and started thinking ‚Äúthat was pretty damned good. Why did I turn my back on it at the time? Why wasn‚Äôt I listening to the same music that my contemporaries were listening to?‚Äù 

I guess what I‚Äôm really saying is that  my life is one long confusing mess.üòÄ

And yeah, Prince wrote a boring song (everything he wrote sounds like crap to me).  2) I don't have a favorite style and I am very eclectic on this ground (but I do like some rock, am very selective about blues and totally dislike metal). Also believe it or not I am a pop guy but it won't mean that I will like EVERYTHING. Regardless my ABBA comment I do love them although they have a few unsupportable songs. Now about Bangles in my opinion they had only one master piece that is Walk Like An Egyptian - everything else is impossible to listen to in my opinion.

644,Ugx1ogCydbmraH44P754AaABAg,Michael Triba,"@San Diego No doubt; and it sounds like you and I were among those, eh?  For me it was her 6th album, ""If You Love Me, Let Me Know"" that did it in 1974 when I was 23.  By the time she released her 13th album ""Physical"" in 1981, I was getting physical with my real, and not imaginary lover.  I married my wife, and the love of my life in the autumn of that year.  If I had to rank all my crushes of female singers, she would likely be in my All-Time Top 10.  What I know of her, she seems to be a lovely woman.  Actually, O N-J is almost 2 years older than me.  Researching Wikipedia for this comment I was sad to just read this Diego:  ""Following an initial misdiagnosis of sciatica, in May 2017 it was announced that Newton-John's breast cancer had returned and metastasized to her lower back.  Newton-John subsequently revealed that this is actually her third bout with cancer and that she had privately battled the disease in 2013.  In 2017, it was also reported that the cancer had progressed to Stage IV and spread to her bones.""  Bone cancer is usually a slow, painful death sentence, so my thoughts and prayers are for her and her family.  Latest word is that she is still battling the cancer and doing well.

They get sooooo much attention compared to generations past. We live in a child worship culture today. In the past, kids were actually ignored, ate last and got scraps left from the adults. You ever hear the term, ""Children are to be seen, not heard""? It was real and the adults were serious. Kid opened his mouth he would get a backhand across his face. It is both funny and sad how new generation kids think they are so abused or unheard. They just have no clue what was before. To them, it seems, time did not exist until they did.

Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
It's just a manic Monday",2017-08-14T00:17:47Z,0

1349,UggF26v2kFLAHHgCoAEC,Human Bein',"+Alex Bouffard¬†¬† Alex, I suggest you keep up your research if you are interested. The Bangles were VERY big in the 80's and anybody who was into music will know that. Even those that did not like them. Try to find somebody that can name 3 songs by Duran Duran. George Michael, Whitesnake, all big in the 80's. See what you come up with. Bangles were very well known, and if your a Band¬†and songs are¬†remembered 30 years after your done, that's no small accomplishment. (even if it's just a few)¬†¬† Prince had such a range of songs and styles that have to be heard to really appreciate his talent. Yes he did make it less accessible to the public in later years because of his dealings with the record companies and publishing. I myself have been sick of ""Purple Rain"" for around 25 years now! So I am not gonna get into that. If you don't like the song..........well I don't know what to tell you. I would give all his other work a listen though. Man made a lot of great music.¬†¬† In the end I think they both got the amount of credit they deserve.¬† And that is a all I have to say about that. Take care.",2016-04-26T16:23:14Z,0
1350,UggF26v2kFLAHHgCoAEC,Alex Bouffard,"+Human Bein&#39; Sigh. I had a really long reply that I wrote and it disappeared on me. Gonna try it again. The Bangles definitely were popular in the 80's but their image was mostly as a pop band and no one really knew how many hard rockers they had. 

But yes they weren't really revolutionary especially since their basis was off of the Paisely Underground which the movement's entire point was to take the sounds of the 60's and to modernize them. So in principle. their music wasn't revolutionary. But then again, being revolutionary can be overrated too. Big whoop if you make a totally different sound. If the sound isn't good, it isn't good. Sometimes just being the best amongst a popular genre is enough too.

I am now about to argue that Prince is both overrated and underrated. I am saying he is underrated because I as a young person never heard a song of his until after his death. He is one of the most famous artists of all time and many young people such as myself have overlooked him so I would argue that he is underrated. (Mostly due to his famous fighting against iTunes, YouTube and other digital music providers that he didn't want his music on which I can't blame him. Still guess what band I bought albums from and what artist that I have ignored thus far...)

I now am going to argue that he is overrated because I now have heard his supposed best song in Purple Rain. It was his performance during the Super Bowl halftime show. I don't get what's so special about it. In fact, it was kind of boring. How was it revolutionary? Granted, it was a live performance with what I would argue is poor quality, so I won't hold permanent judgement until  I buy the studio album and listen to it as Prince intended me to.

I watched the entire Super Bowl halftime show and was disinterested. I'm not calling him a bad songwriter. He wrote Manic Monday for crying out loud! I know he's talented! But I'm potentially arguing that he's an overrated performer. Or at the very least he gave a boring performance during the Super Bowl. Or the sound quality was just so horrid that it ruined all chance of me enjoying it.

My point in all of this is, it all comes down to an individual's opinion of the artist or band. Obviously The Bangles were not as influential as Prince nor as popular.(or at least for not as long as he was) But it all comes down to each person's perspective of an artist to really determine who is really ""overrated"" or ""underrated"".

So I don't think anyone in this thread is wrong. We all just have differing opinions.",2016-04-26T06:22:56Z,0

1352,UggF26v2kFLAHHgCoAEC,Human Bein',"+Alex Bouffard¬†¬† Not tryin' to give you a hard time over this Alex, but you have already owned up to being bias towards them. So that seems like a rather obvious reason to believe them to be underrated when in fact they are not. They are very well known, had superstar status at their peak, and were given credit for what they did with their vocals and playing. To go beyond any acclaim they did, or continue to receive would in truth be overrating them. They were not revolutionary or musically brilliant. They were good. no more no less. I as well as my social circle at the time had, and were familiar with their albums, not just their singles. There were a good deal of songs that were¬†so-so at¬†best with¬†a few¬†very good ones ¬†mixed in. ""James"", ""Hero Takes a Fall,"" ""Going Down to Liverpool"", ""If She Knew What She Wants"". Great material that was surrounded by a lot of filler. MAYBE their harmonies get overlooked a bit, but generally they get the credit they deserve.",2016-04-25T05:57:46Z,0

composing, producing, arranging and performing the music for his first 5 records entirely by himself(with Lisa Coleman offering occasional backing  vocals). This alone makes him more poignant, unique
and prolific than most artists as the average pop artist rarely even write their own vocal hooks.


As well, he's regarded by guitarists such as Steve Vai, Nuno Bettencourt and Richie Kotzen as one of the world's best rhythm and  lead players. The improvisation in his live solos is quite impressive. 
 Whether or not you like the sound of his music has nothing to do with it. Even if I hated all his songs I'd still have to give him the credit of being a musical visionary.",2015-11-09T11:41:33Z,2
