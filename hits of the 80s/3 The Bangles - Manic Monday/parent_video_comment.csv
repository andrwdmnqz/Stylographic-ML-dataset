I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal-blue, Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made
It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)
It's just another manic Monday
Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long (Oh, oh)
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there
It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)
It's just another manic Monday
Of all my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)

When you wish your bed was already made
It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long (Oh, oh)
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train

My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)
It's just another manic Monday
Of all my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)
It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)

Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out
What I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

All of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
""I don't have to run"" day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day

Today at school during lunch I legitimately had to convince the homies that yes, Helen Keller was, in fact, a real person and not just Anne Frank’s alter ego. On top of that, we started learning about WW1 in history, and science class was a total zoo.
Yep, safe to say it was a very Manic Monday.

And if I had an aeroplane

Blame it on the train

Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast

768,UgxZ3YHxIcyDUXbtt9l4AaABAg,"Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream

もう朝６時
私は　真っ只中だった　夢の
キスしてたんだ　ヴァレンティノに
ほとりで　水晶のように光る　青い　
イタリアの小川の

But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

でも　出来ない　遅刻は
なぜなら　思うから
もらえなくなると　お給料が
これが毎日
願えば　ベッドが出てくればいいのに

<※1>
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

それは　ありきたりの　慌ただしい月曜日
私は願う　日曜日だったらいいのにと
だって　それは楽しい日だから
しなくていい　駆け回ることも　その日は
それは　ありふれた　騒がしい月曜日

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an air-o-plane
I still couldn't make it on time

乗らなくちゃ　早い列車に
仕事を始めなきゃ　９時までに
もし　持っていたとしても　飛行機を
やっぱり　間に合わなかった　時間には

'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

だって　時間がかかるから
ただ決めるだけなのに　何を着ていくのかを
咎める　それを　列車の中で
なのに　上司は　もう　そこにいる

<※1繰り返し>

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down

全ての夜
なぜ私の恋人は　選ぶ必要があったのか　昨夜を
やって来るのに
それは大したことじゃないけど
私は養わなくちゃいけない　私達２人を
雇用は減ってる

He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
When you're having fun

彼は話す　私に　甘い夜の声で
おいでハニー　行こう　騒ぎに
時間は過ぎて行く　とても速く
楽しんでいる時は

I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal-blue, Italian stream

But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time

'Cause it takes me so long (Oh, oh)
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)
It's just another manic Monday

Of all my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down

He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah, woah, woah)

1322,UgxOY_uXIBoVv-qiSpN4AaABAg,"The lyrics of this song is so timeless, and relatable.  I remembered when I used to struggle to find employment, and my boyfriend at the time, constantly threatened to kick me out for not financially contributing.  Mind you, I cooked, cleaned, ran errands, had dinner, and a BJ waiting for him every night when he got off work, so I was still contributing.  

Soon as I started working at the nursing home as a housekeeper, I was too exhausted to do any housework in between my shifts, my bf and I had delivery more often rather than cook at home.  I had to do chores on my days off, my feet ached too much to go out anywhere anyway.  My bf would often get mad at me for not giving him some on a worknight.  I'd be like ""Hey, this is what you wanted.  I'm too tired, you only get 2 days a week from now on, on my days off.  I got work tomorrow, goodnight.""  lol",Mia Rosenbloom,3,2021-04-20T07:56:21Z

1439,Ugx6A38AONIHSFSbykJ4AaABAg,"Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal-blue, Italian stream

But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time

'Cause it takes me so long (Oh, oh)
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)
It's just another manic Monday

Of all my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us?
Employment's down

He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah)
'Cause that's my fun day (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
My I don't have to run day (Woah, woah)

It's just another manic Monday (Woah, woah)
I wish it was Sunday (Woah, woah, woah, woah)

1571,Ugz07MaGOmTX1wRfjoh4AaABAg,"Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out
What I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

All of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
""I don't have to run"" day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
It's just a manic Monday",William Saavedra,25,2021-02-19T03:31:25Z

I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out
What I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

All of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
""I don't have to run"" day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
It's just a manic Monday",Ciro CIROMERO,22,2020-10-04T22:22:01Z

I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday
Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an air-o-plane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there
All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast

They do the sand dance, don't you know?
If they move too quick (oh-way-oh)
They're falling down like a domino

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

[Verse 2: Michael Steele]
The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

[Verse 3: Susanna Hoffs]
Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian

I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream

But I can't be late

These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

I wish it were Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time

'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday (oh,oh)
I wish it were Sunday (oh, oh)
'Cause that's my fun day (oh, oh)
My I don't have to run day (oh)

Of all of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down

He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise.""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

Estaba justo en el medio de un sueño
Estaba besando a Valentino en un rio azul transparente italiano
Pero no puedo llegar tarde
Porque luego supongo que no van a pagarme
Estos son los días
Cuando desearía que la cama estuviera ya tendida

Solo es otro lunes lunático
Desearía que fuera domingo
Porque ese es mi día divertido
Mi día ""no tengo que correr""
Solo es otro lunes lunático

Tengo que alcanzar el tren temprano
Tengo que estar en el trabajo a las nueve
Si tuviera un aeroplano
Aún no podría llegar a tiempo
Porque me toma mucho tiempo solo para decidir
Que ropa voy a vestir
Echale la culpa al tren
Pero el jefe ya estaba allá

Solo es otro lunes lunático
Quisiera que fuera domingo
Porque ese es mi día feliz
Mi día ""no tengo que correr""
Solo es otro lunes lunático


De todas mis noches
Por qué mi amante tuvo que elegir anoche
Para caer?
(anoche, anoche)
No importa acaso
Que tuve que alimentarnos a ambos
El empleo esta bajo
Me decia con su voz de habitación
Vamos, miel, vamos a hacer mucho ruido
El tiempo se va tan rápido
(Cuando estas pasándola bueno) 

Solo es otro lunes lunático
Yo quisiera que fuera domingo
Porque ese es mi día divertido 
Mi día ""no tengo que correr""
Solo es otro lunes lunático

Solo es otro lunes lunático
Yo quisiera que fuera domingo
Porque ese es mi día divertido

3085,UgwuyHres_IY2UkEcO54AaABAg,"I remember this song. My ex boyfriend Simon Theo Johnson said I just looked like Susannah, the lead singer of this group. I got grounded for over 2 months for seeing this boy and taking me to Halifax to his house instead of going to youth club. He was 5 years too old for me and kept pestering me to go out with him when I was in the chorus line of Mother Goose. Eventually I gave in to his demand to go out with me after his several failed attempts to ask me out. 

I wondered why a customer Firth pollard was getting distressed when I spoke about the subject to another customer Rex the dinosaur? I had no clue or idea what happened to him after 1985!!! I moved on and started dating Steve Parrish. 🤷🏻‍♀️✌️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤕😩🧘‍♀️",Anonymous Peaceful person,1,2020-02-14T09:08:13Z

Prince wrote ""Manic Monday"" in 1984, and recorded it as a duet for the band Apollonia 6's self-titled album; however, he eventually pulled the song. 

Two years later, he offered the single to The Bangles under the pseudonym ""Christopher"", a character he played in the 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon.

Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late 'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days When you wish your bed was already made


Prince *Grown up lyrics*

I was dreamin' when I wrote this, 

forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this mornin', 

could've sworn it was judgment day
The sky was all purple, there were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction, you know I didn't even care",Gonzo Balls,2,2019-11-21T06:55:40Z

I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an air-o-plane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
When you're having fun",Rogério Lopes,166,2019-10-01T16:25:24Z

3602,UgzxVBZj8Svg2qwbcRd4AaABAg,"💜Did you see Prince's EYE at the very beginning of the video!!! The original version of this song on Prince's album The Originals is only a demo ( demonstration) that he made so that the singer can follow how to perform the song. That's why this is a more polished version and Prince's version is a little rougher. Prince does play the keyboards and the synthesizer on The Bangles version too. 
              This song was originally written for the group Apollonia 6 to go on their debut album. But Prince believe that The Bangles would be able to perform it better and give the song some longevity. The same thing he did with the song The Glamorous Life. That was written about Apollonia or Vanity. But once again Prince gave it to an artist he felt could present the song better. Sheila E could not only sing it, she could  perform the procussions while she's doing it. Two smart choices on Prince's part.💜",Purple Flowers,2,2019-08-09T22:33:08Z

I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out
What I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

All of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
""I don't have to run"" day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
It's just a manic Monday",Behruz Huseynov,3,2019-07-12T16:00:08Z

I was just in the middle of a dream

I was kissing Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream

But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid

These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine

And if I had an air-o-plane
I still couldn't make it on time

'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear

Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there 

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Of all of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night to get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down

He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise.""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday 
I wish it were Sunday 
'Cause that's my fun day 
My I don't have to run day 

It's just another manic Monday 
I wish it was Sunday 
'Cause that's my fun day 
It's just another manic Monday",aragor iluvatar,66,2019-05-08T02:40:19Z

I wasn't quite old enough to enjoy the 80's but I damn sure enjoyed the 90's. Kids today just don't understand how much different it was. As useful as the internet and smartphones are, not having them back then really helped you to be free. You weren't at home getting online, texting people or playing games. You went out with friends and ran all over the place having fun and meeting girls and there were far more people out looking to have fun. It was incredible. Today there are not near as many people out and there is so much traffic everywhere that  you can't enjoy riding around town meeting girls the way you could back then.

I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonnawear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it really matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
When you're having fun

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

4392,UgyQ8_wiWuBfi0Kms2d4AaABAg,"When this was in the charts, I was a 20 something-year-old signing on the dole under Maggie Thatcher and the Tories in the UK, part of it was because jobs were harder to get back then and part of it was because I decided that the whole system sucked and if I got a job I would become a part of that system, so I was happy to stay unemployed, although I made some token efforts to look for work as the dole office required me to.

Of course, I've done some growing up since then lol and I have had loads of jobs and work now even though I'll be 55 this year, but deep down, I still have that same ideology as I did back then, it's just that I keep it to myself, this song, in some ways, has that same undertone of her quietly questioning herself, wishing her life was different, wanting to run away from reality and even though she had a job, she was wondering why she was bothering to get up in the morning because it was a road to nowhere and I could relate to that even back then and still do today to a certain extent, that's why I remember this song and checked it out on Youtube :)",John Cashin,0,2019-02-05T19:00:55Z

4637,Ugwpc8TXFJanGYNnP154AaABAg,"""Manic Monday""

Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out
What I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

All of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
""I don't have to run"" day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
It's just a manic Monday",Henrique Ramos,0,2018-12-02T00:13:42Z

4778,Ugyz9PGo7oEIa5YHgIx4AaABAg,"Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made
It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday
Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an air-o-plane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there
All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
When you're having fun

4850,Ugw8wdOTHoB6cYRjPFZ4AaABAg,"Parmadale Orphanage and it’s 13 cottages, Church, school and gymnasium is mostly demolished as are the hopes of millions of people’s lives being saved by a series of TV shows I promoted for 20 months called Parmadale’s Resurrection where pet therapy would have dramatized the healing of human suffering.  Where 5% of advertising profits would have gone to the City of Parma, 5% would have gone to the Parma City School District and the rest would have gone to animal welfare organizations and the humanitarian suffering each of the cottages’ shows would have dealt with.

Had Parmadale been given to me, there isn’t a TV executive in the world who would have not fought for the broadcast rights. The narration and merits were explained to virtually all Parma residents in over a hundred facebook posts.
 
 
The Parmadale’s Resurrection shows would have raised $234 million yearly, nearly forever to the City of Parma and school board  so it could have provided funding to  fix it’s sewers which causes flooding for 10,000 of it’s 32,000 homes which makes them unhealthy to live in, depilated roads and countless school problems including having no air conditioning and so few facilities they frequently have to close schools, leaving 6,000 students of low income parents who have to either miss work or pay for a baby sitter to have to sacrifice their food budgets for the week. Along with so many problems that Parma City School District is near the worst in the state of Ohio and probably no better on a national level.

Parma had a chance to solve all their problems and have financial stability forever without having to spend a single tax dollar ever, nor take any tax payer grant money from any other organization, while turning a network called ION Life(with Jewel’s show at 3, Dr. Oz at 4, Anna and Kristina at 5, then millions of viewers watching cats and dogs heal human suffering until 11)  into a major network for only a few million dollars for broadcast rights and intellectual property rights for social cause TV.  Parma could have had the most beautiful perfect entity ever incarnated, equaling We Are the World’s humanitarian fund raising over the last 33 years in but PR’s first 4 months. 

The city of Parma had no concern for the world even if they themselves could be helped. The world should give nothing to Parma. 
 
Parmadale’s Resurrection would have also raised nearly $4 billion for the healing of human suffering, which could have saved the lives of 4 million people every year and started a copy cat nature of TV shows that I promoted as social cause TV that would have raised at least $500 billion for humanitarian benefit yearly forever. Hopefully, Parma’s barbaric atrocity will inspire facebookers and youtubers throughout the world to start similar shows in their hometowns using building in fear of demolition.
 
 
I appealed to Nicole Curtis(Rehab Addict star) many times from day one back to January of 2017. But the self-proclaimed goddess of goodness, self-proclaimed maker of heaven and earth and moral compass of the world decided instead to have her Season 8 be about some stupid Road 14 Mile home, then a season 9 home in her hometown. Neither of which had any significant historical effect. Yet, the most important place on earth for the healing of human suffering, whose ideals of love, care and compassion replacing electro shock therapy, water submersion and lobotomies lead to hundreds of millions of lives saved since 30,000 humanitarians came from throughout the world to Pamadale’s opening on January 23, 1925 wasn’t apparently important enough to even respond to.
 
 
But the most barbaric atrocity occurred when the owners of Parmadale, Parma Community Improvement Corporation with it’s board members Parma Mayor Tim Degeeter, Economic Development Director Erik Tollerup and Auditor Brian Day joined the most perverted relationship with the most needlessly superficial organization West Creek to spend $9 million to transform the area into basically a forest which according to grant proposals would have no economic or environmental benefit to Parma  nor anyone it the world at all.
 
 
Degeeter, Tollerup, Day, two private citizen board members of the PCIC and West Creek Conservancy  despite 410 pages of facebook postings over 20 months about the  documentation of Parmadale Resurrection’s merits, beautifully perfect business plans, made the most barbaric response possibly anyone has ever made. Just let millions of people die, so we can have our 40 acres more of parks.  The probable deaths of millions of people are the responsibility of Degeeter, Tollerup and Day and West Creek. I can only hope these national postings will inspire the nation to evolve social cause TV which can hopefully prevent those deaths Parma officials didn’t care about.
 
 
Even when Parma residents would have benefited tremendously, Degeeter, Tollerup and Day still turned their backs on their own residents.  It is beyond any level of human acceptability for the nation not to scorn Parma for turning their backs on the world’s suffering-for a park. For even despite that without Parmadale, there never would have been a Parma, Parma Heights or Seven Hills, 98% of facebook posts ridiculed PR, mostly on a faceook page “Meanwhile In Parma” and not until days before demolition did anyone voice a public opinion.  One last Parma ordinance 146-18 had a chance to save Parmadale. But not one city council member voted to have concern for humanity and not West Creek’s needless superficiality which now has an incalculable death toll. 
 
 
According to a Tollerup’s facebook like of my comment, not even if I had a TV contract in hand would Parmadale be saved, along with saving homeless people, AIDS patients, Leukemia, Cancer, Rape and Domestic Violence victims, Autism and Downs Syndrome people, and all the others the advertising profits would have provided direct aid, research funding, education, motivation and an endless list of ways in decades to come that pet therapy and the advertising profits would have saved millions of lives. Tollerup, Day, Degeeter and West Creek put more value in the grant’s proposal stated benefit as adding more area to kill deer, cats and bunny rabbits, then not just saving millions of lives even if they can save their own residents.

Hopefully, social cause TV will find cures for diseases saving millions, provide funding to help millions who would otherwise die, house the homeless, heal the suffering and save the lives of all the millions of people Parmadale could have saved if not burdened by being in Parma.
 
 
It’s absolutely unfathomable that the residents haven’t at the least called for them to resign and haven’t stopped supporting West Creek. During my tireless 20 month crusade not was there a single protest, demonstration, vigil or even one facebook posting by anyone other than me. 
 
One can only hope that this national tragedy and barbaric disregard for human life that Degeeter, Tollerup and Day joined together with West Creek Conservancy, can somehow serve as a martyr to having PR’s vision resurrected, even if 2,000 dumpsters are hauling away the debris to sit in landfills to sit for 20 years creating a huge massive ecological footprint from a supposed environmental organization.
 
 
The below video shows what West Creek did to a place that was relatively rehabable on August 2017 when they basically trashed the place like vandals and scavengers when it still looked like the Parmadale’s 90th Anniversary video.

Six o' clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonnawear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it really matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
When you're having fun

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day

Zak is front of the local library, the security guy in the kart makes a stupid remark about how he has plastered his name all over the place, Zak is completely indifferent.  Zak finds him self in the local business park as kids rush into stores happy and full of zeil as their milf mothers bring them into the stores with smiles on their faces!!!! Zak finds himself going to a local trash can (Music chimes in) Zak looks into the garbage and see's jimmy hoffa asleep with a news paper on his face, Zak brushes some garbage bags, (Jimmy wakes up with a loud snore) (Jimmy) Hey pal you are kinda of blowing up my spot here..what gives you stuttering fuck??!! (Zak) Jimmy it has been a while man sorry dude just looking for something to eat man...(Jimmy hands zak a untainted garbage can meal and some smokes) (Jimmy) Here you go you fucker no fuck off before the Feds run me down like a rhino on a rice paddy!! Zak then sits down and eats the tasty meal and smokes himself a fine smoke, and washes it down with some soda and cold water.  Zak then finds him self walking towards the Walmart a finds another heart trash can full to the brim with all sorts of unwanted foods items.  Zak then finds a series of snipes and catches a glimpse of his beloved all is well in the universe zak then lays his head down at night and sleeps a few hours and wakes up to another new day!",Zak Bond,1,2018-07-09T17:50:21Z

to this wonderful 🆒
Monday song.?❣️?😏

One of my MOST favorite
songs!ღゝ◡╹)ノ♡🎶🎧

""Manic Monday""

Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
It's just a manic Monday",Mei MayTube,13,2018-05-28T01:06:09Z

5873,UgyijU6KeelDvfDBbpt4AaABAg,"Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an airplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out
What I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My ""I don't have to run"" day
It's just another manic Monday

All of my nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
""I don't have to run"" day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
It's just a manic Monday",Megan Parker,0,2017-12-26T09:27:29Z

5942,UgyS3aDBDUwLYWCGEVZ4AaABAg,"I like the Bangles a lot and they had modest success, but when you look at the Billboard charts they did not write a lot of their hits.  For example, they only during their history had 8 top 40 hits and of those, only 2 were cowritten by Susanna Hoffs and one was a hit written solely by Debbie Peterson:
Walk Like An Egyptian - #1 - written by Liam Sternberg for The Bangles
Eternal Flame - #1 - written by Susanna Hoffs, Tom Kelly, and Billy Steinberg (who also played with Fleetwood Mac for a time)
Hazy Shade of Winter - #2 - written by Simon and Garfunkle, modified by the Bangles
Manic Monday - #2 - written by Prince for The Bangles
In Your Room - #5 - written by Susanna Hoffs, Tom Kelly, and Billy Steinberg

Walking Down Your Street - #11 - written by Susanna Hoffs, Louis Gutierrez, David Khane (produced for everyone including Paul McCartney, Sugar Ray, Kelly Clarkson, Tony Bennet, and many others)

If She Knew What She Wants - #29 - written by Jules Sheer
Be With You - #30 - written by Debbie Peterson 

I know they are talented - I know they were a great all female band in the 1980s and did reasonably well coming back in 2003, but I was shocked to learn that they really did not write any of the biggest hits we heard on the radio (knowing that Prince and Simon and Garfunkel were responsible for two of them).",Sam S,0,2017-11-30T16:06:36Z

But I do get why there would be trouble with the crediting - there's nothing wprse than getting shared credit, or most of the credit going to the person who didn't write it because of the name that comes first (i.e. Lennon/Mccartney for a purely Lennon song or a purely McCartney song)",Kai Johnson,0,2017-09-03T00:03:06Z

this wonderful 
song?!? 💋😏🎧

One of my MOST favorite
songs!ღゝ◡╹)ノ♡🎶🎧

""Manic Monday""

Six o'clock already
I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an aeroplane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

It's just another manic Monday
Wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down?
(Last night, last night)
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise""
Time it goes so fast
(When you're having fun)

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it were Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
I don't have to run day

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
It's just a manic Monday",Mei MayTube,0,2017-08-14T00:12:51Z

I can remember the day and who I was with the day I heard this song because I can do that with all 80s songs as I was young and it meant something as I knew id be at the record shop the weekend with my wages.      Today its really just not fun.  too sexual.",Craig Beale,0,2017-04-28T21:18:21Z

I was just in the middle of a dream
I was kissin' Valentino
By a crystal blue Italian stream
But I can't be late
'Cause then I guess I just won't get paid
These are the days
When you wish your bed was already made

It's just another manic Monday
I wish it was Sunday
'Cause that's my fun day
My I don't have to run day
It's just another manic Monday

Have to catch an early train
Got to be to work by nine
And if I had an air-o-plane
I still couldn't make it on time
'Cause it takes me so long
Just to figure out what I'm gonna wear
Blame it on the train
But the boss is already there

All of the nights
Why did my lover have to pick last night
To get down
Doesn't it matter
That I have to feed the both of us
Employment's down
He tells me in his bedroom voice
C'mon honey, let's go make some noise
Time it goes so fast
When you're having fun",Dulce González,81,2016-09-28T02:50:38Z

Sorry, but even men have relationships with some women they will give up sleep to be with.   Yes, it's dysfunctional. But haven't we all been there at some point? 
This is what I love about music!  When someone else sings about the crazy emotions or even painful memories, it somehow is therapeutic to know you're not the only one who ever felt that way.

--- Citat (Oprindeligt af Mads Hutters) ---
Da jeg var en lille dreng og i 1974-1975 mødte en dansk talende Alien når jeg blinkede i børnehave, der fortalte mig ""for at komme tilbage til børnehave - du nødt til at gå ned korridoren og springe gennem hul i gulvet"" Jeg gjorde det hurtigt og sad tilbage i chock. Et par dage senere kom halvt usynlige kvinde på min børnehave og sagde i dansk ""Du er for gammel til at gå i børnehave og tog mig som en går ud døren jeg nye i en alder af 5-6 år, at min mor ikke kunne Forklar det til mig. jeg har glemt alt om det. 1989 jeg Becan at høre Voices grund af, hvad jeg i fortvivlelse forsøger at aldrig tænke over. jeg hørte den lokale Psyk og havde givet 600 piller som medicin til tre måneder. jeg var under uddannelse til Typo tech Titian og den dag jeg kom hjem havde jeg noget at spise, så jeg besluttede at spise alle de piller (Ikke en Suicide) .Næste dag jeg vågnede kom til Job 06:00 halv time senere fik jeg en gnist på min højre pegefinger og pludselig havde jeg en dårlig følelse som jeg kunne dø, hvis jeg blinkede og huskede, hvorfor det ikke var
sundt at spise alle dem Fluphenazin og så pludselig kom der et stjerneskud i vinduet foran mig og ud af vinduet bag mig igen chokeret over hvad der var sket, jeg bemærket Sun ændret farve til at være Neon par uger senere havde jeg til at dække min Windows, så jeg kunne ikke se Neon Sun og stoppede min uddannelse og igen forsøger at glemme begge ting, jeg lykkedes indtil 1999. så jeg drømmer jeg levede som dreng på hans familie 16-17 år i flere uger på samme drøm der opstod så den person herfra kommer til drømmen, og jeg stod på 2th sal, og det hele blev halvt synlige og noget (relateret til hullet i gulvet Monster) lidt mindre end en bowling terning kravlede på bagsiden af ​​drengen jeg drømte jeg var, og det kunne ikke stoppe efter mange gange ekstra det eksploderer i en hvid eksplosion og jeg kan lide kigget på hvid eksplosion bliver større og større fra ud af rummet par dage senere jeg drømmer jeg er den halve, der gik sine egne veje i Kindergarden han levede som udødelig som i
dungeons og drager i et sted, hvor de alle talte dansk der den kvinde, jeg husker talte til mig i Kinder have sagt jeg skulle rejse tilbage til her og dræber mig, mens jeg sover. Efter 5000 år I / han her kravlede gennem det åbne vindue så på ""min"" Computer blinke og lignende forsvandt, da han / jeg så mig selv i sengen jeg vågnede og chokeret. 2001 oplevede den evige Eksplosion næsten besvimede 2005 Jeg drømmer jeg er den udødelige spøgelse i en hvid verden intet andet Alt var hvidt og tiden gik som jeg ikke kunne vågne op efter 40 milliarder år, jeg / han overtog jeg så den evige Eksplosion ned gennem og jeg vågnede. 2011 Jeg drømte det sted den kvinde, jeg mødte i børnehave ""Den Evige Dal"" blev ramt af den stadigt voksende evige eksplosion ligesom varig 40 milliarder års torden da jeg huskede det hele og skrevet ned, hvad gør u antager skete?

So this song goes: 'Six o Clock already I was just in the middle of a dream...', and '1999' goes: 'I was dreaming when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray'. 

The melody is the same. If he'd sang both songs, people would have said he's ripping himself off. Giving 'Manic Monday' another group makes it one step removed.",Ben R,0,2015-12-16T06:26:57Z

Estaba besando a Valentino por una corriente italiana azul cristalina 
Pero no puedo llegar tarde porque entonces, supongo, que no me pagarán 
Estos son los días en los que desearias que tu cama estuviera ya hecha 

Es solo otro lunes maniático (oh – aflicción) 
Desearia que fuera Domingo (oh – afliccion) 
Porque ese es mi día de diversión (oh – aflicción)
Mi día de “No-tengo-que correr” 
Es solo otro lunes maniático. 

Tengo que tomar un tren temprano, tengo que estar en el trabajo a las nueve 
Y si tuviera un aeroplano, aún así no llegaría a tiempo 
Porque me toma mucho tiempo simplemente decidir que voy a usar 
Culpar al tren pero el jefe ya está ahí. 

Es solo otro lunes maniático (oh – aflicción) 
Desearia que fuera Domingo (oh – afliccion) 
Porque ese es mi día de diversión (oh – aflicción)
Mi día de “No-tengo-que correr” 
Es solo otro lunes maniático. 

De todas mis noches ¿porqué mi amante tuvo que escoger la de ayer para bajar (la noche de ayer, la noche de ayer) 
¿Acaso importa que yo tengo que alimentar a ambos? los empleos están abajo 
El me dice en su voz de dormitorio: 
“Mi nena, vamos a hacer algo de ruido” (ba ba ba baaaa) 
El tiempo se va tan rápido (cuando te estás divirtiendo) 

Es solo otro lunes maniático (oh – aflicción) 
Desearia que fuera Domingo (oh – afliccion) 
Porque ese es mi día de diversión (oh – aflicción)
Mi día de “No-tengo-que correr”(aflicción) 
Es solo otro lunes maniático (oh – aflicción) 
Desearia que fuera Domingo (oh – afliccion) 
Porque ese es mi día de diversión (oh) 
Es solo otro lunes maniático.

I was kissin' Valentino by a crystal blue Italian stream 
But I can't be late 'cause then I guess I just won't get paid 
These are the days when you wish your bed was already made. 

It's just another manic Monday (oh-woe) 
I wish it was Sunday (oh-woe) 
'Cause that's my Funday (oh-woe) 
My I don't have to runday (oh) 
It's just another manic Monday. 

Have to catch an early train, got to be to work by nine 
And if I had an air-o-plane, I still couldn't make it on time 
'Cause it takes me so long just to figure out what I'm gonna wear 
Blame it on the train but the boss is already there. 

It's just another manic Monday (oh-woe) 
I wish it was Sunday (oh-woe) 
'Cause that's my Funday (oh-woe) 
My I don't have to runday (oh) 
It's just another manic Monday. 

All of my nights why did my lover have to pick last 
night to get down (last night, last night) 
Doesn't it matter that I have to feed the both of us, 
employment's down 
He tells me in his bedroom voice: 
""C'mon honey, let's go make some noise"" (ba ba ba baaaa) 
Time, it goes so fast (when you're having fun). 

It's just another manic Monday (oh-woe) 
I wish it was Sunday (oh-woe) 
'Cause that's my Funday (oh-woe) 
My I don't have to runday (woe) 
It's just another manic Monday (oh-woe)
