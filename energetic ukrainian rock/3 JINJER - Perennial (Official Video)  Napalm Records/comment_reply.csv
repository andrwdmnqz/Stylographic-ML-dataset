Jinjer is hipster metal,  don't believe the hype!
Otherwise, no need to be jealousy, listen what you want. I can stand it...
Jinjer would be an acceptable metalcore band, they should delete, this wannabe pop,jazz, fusion elements, avoid clean vocals!!!- and kick some ass...trying to sound proggy, and be really able, to compose it, makes the difference! 

But, it's only my opinion.

even though she is one of the best - at least female - growlers, she also has really good transitions between ""clean"" singing and growling, she doesnt reach tatianas skill in both (plus tatiana is sooo versatile due to her styles, she`s really killing so much stuff ).

result: tati - alissa (sry alissa) 4-0 .

never heard a singer like that before in my entire life, deep stuff, blows you away with totally insane mix of athmosphere and emotional rollercoaster, top notch - nothing, i say nothing compares to tatiana...

98,UgyJIPJgNW8xV3Smryt4AaABAg,Warren Harrison,"I haven't done metal in a long time, last CDs I bought were in the 90's. I'm open to music and fairly eclectic in what I listen too, last few years has been weqx station out of Albany NY/Manchester VT, it the only thing that's held my interest and occasionally there's some harder songs on there, they stay very new and recent on their play list. My youngest brother Ethan Harrison is front man for Great American Ghost out of NH, his growth into the hard growling metal brought my interests around again these last few years, it was a younger friend that shared Jinjer a year plus ago, I was blown away, but time moves along and things fade out of my mind so did Jinjer. Skip to just this last week and Jinjer slipped back into my life, I am so thankful, what an amazing group, been soaking up all I can. This group checks all the boxes for me.

Those damn reaction videos did a lot for this band to get people introduced, and the quality of the music has kept people listening. This band has progressed so much over the last two releases.

I'm here with her undressed With a few petals on my breasts We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone. We fixed our eyes up to the sky To see a flight send us farewell Goodbye! May we see each other next time. So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life! Then as now fly! Today you reached the point of no return. Now cry! And then die! Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored. Annual tradition of mass destruction In the name of total reconstruction. My biggest source of confusion The reason of decay and dissolution. Under permanent ice we found a breathless paradise No, we¬¥re not dead, No, we¬¥re not dead, Just enjoying coma!

No it isn't. Perception is not reality.

I will do all of that just for you, seeing as you have now stated it is "" whatever "" I say it is.

""Not going to reply after this one. Bye.""

That is your choice. You have clearly chosen to concede, rather than attempt to prove me wrong. Though If you could have you would have by now. Cheers.",2019-01-14T23:03:47Z,0
555,UgxiJUdsx3p78b4Dept4AaABAg,Theenragedone,""" Nitpicking typos, are we?""

No I  was telling you to quote me correctly, if you are going to quote me. Was it your perception that I was ""nitpicking? ""

""Welp, that's the natural course of things when one is bereft of arguments. ""

You have not posted anything that refutes my arguments. 


""I'm positive that mr. Stu is probably an extremely talented vocalist. ""

Does this mean you have not heard him.

""hat said, it doesn't mean that the ladies Brittney and Tatiana are not.""

Tatiana is a outstanding vocalist in the studio, and a good vocalist live, but there is a large difference in what she is capable of live, vs the studio. Which is what I have said. You have posted nothing to refute that other than mentioning ""alleged vocal coaches. 

Brittney is a good vocalist, but I haven't heard anything that makes me think she is a great vocalist. I wouldn't listen to her over other Power Metal singers. She has a terrible habit of cupping the mic live which causes several different issues that hurt her vocal performance.",2019-01-14T22:43:11Z,0
556,UgxiJUdsx3p78b4Dept4AaABAg,Theenragedone,"""Aledged vocal coaches""?""

If you are going to quote me, quote me correctly, and don't misspell the words you are attempting to quote. 

""Man, you're the prime example of a person who has never done anything similar, and yet tries to belittle great artists."" 

This is an assumption, and an incorrect one at that. 

"" Floor is amazing, yes.""

Yes she is.

"" But that doesn't mean that the other two aren't.""

Britteny isn't on the same level as Floor, though few singers are. You are correct Stu is amazing.",2019-01-14T21:46:16Z,0
557,UgxiJUdsx3p78b4Dept4AaABAg,Theenragedone,"""ocal coaches are praising her for her technique, both in cleans and in growls. ""

I've seen the alleged ""vocal coach"" videos.  I was not impressed with any of them. They are also attempting to talk technique on a studio recording, IE the Pisces video. Which while recorded live, has had serious post processing, and vocal layering.  If you watch an actual live, or see her live, her technique is far different.  

""Vocalists can have a bad day; they can be sick while performing, or their vocal chords may be strained from extensive use during the tour. ""

This is commonly used excuse. Yes vocalists can have a bad day. That said Tatiana simply isn't the same vocalist live. I've seen her live, and seen several live recordings. I stand by my previous statements. 

"" Brittney from Unleash the Archers (completely different style of music, I know) is a complete vocal beast, ""

Brittney is a good singer, but not a great singer in my opinion. She has the same issues with mic cupping live that Tatiana does, and it causes the same sound issues.  A better example would be Floor Jansen who has amazing technique, and nails her vocals live, or in the studio.

""Also, the studio recording is a totally different environment.""

Yes they gave metal new life, can't deny that, but Jinjer is on a course to headline and have Gojira opening for them if they keep busting their assess the way they have been. I just hope they don't get burnt out.

To put into perspective about musical technicality, I can play pretty much all of Gojira's songs on guitar, bass, and drums..Jinjer has parts in almost every one of their songs that I can't nail on any of the 3 instruments. Musically, they are better than Gojira, by the numbers, though by sound, I can see why some would say Gojira is better, though anyone who says that likely doesn't play an instrument.

The longest song of grief. 
And not for what has passed 
But for what shall last. 

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal! 
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself! 
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes 
As the last leaf is falling off her head. 
I'm here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone.
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell 

Goodbye! 
May we see each other next time. 
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!

Then as now fly! 
Today you reached the point of no return. 
Now cry! And then die! 
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored. 

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction. 
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and dissolution. 
Under permanent ice we found a breathless paradise 
No, we¬¥re not dead, 
No, we¬¥re not dead, 
Just enjoying coma!

From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again

665,Ugx30Iefo8t6-wDbac94AaABAg,punk 2008,"@Ga√´lB Galbar To be fair there are some hardcore metal fans that don't like this because some of them want this music to be 100% full throttle all of the time with 100% screaming, growling and grunting vocals. For me personally, that 100% being fast and heavy with 100% that kinda vocals gets boring. I get bored to death of those kinda death metal or hardware metal bands. I love Jinjer because they are so different from that very heavy hardcore metal stuff. This mixing of vocals with the timing and tempo changes plus the mixing of other genres in Jinjer's music makes them stand out in this genre in a great way.",2019-01-15T01:24:18Z,0

Impossible. And Sex Pistols -or even Ramones- play too loud for the radio. No, reality is that most of people are not educated to hear such powerful music.

667,Ugx30Iefo8t6-wDbac94AaABAg,punk 2008,"@Ga√´lB Galbar I only got introduced to this band last month and have gotten so addicted to their music ever since. I bought 2 of their CDs and a Tshirt and can't wait for them to tour in the USA in the future. Just found out that they toured in the USA last year so I missed them this past year. I have been introducing this music to friends and coworkers and the ones that like Jinjer are metalheads or people that just love to hear new and original music no matter what genre. The ones that say to me that they don't like Jinjer's music are the ones that mainly listen to mainstream radio as their main source for new music or for many of them they only like the classic rock stuff. With some of these people only classic rock is real and good music and for some others it has to be on the radio for them to appreciate new music. One person 's comment to me was ""if it's not on the radio, it can't be any good"" ? WTF? Yes there really are people like that out there that need the corporate world to feed them music or anything else for that matter and can't go searching for stuff on their own.",2019-01-12T17:40:06Z,0

Honest critique: It didn't really do anything for me. Just really wasn't anything I haven't already heard 100 times. That said, it's competent enough that I think you guys have some potential of you grow your sound a bit more and try some different things. Enough potential that I threw you a subscription for the hell of it, just to keep an eye out and see if it goes anywhere interesting.
