121,UgwCwXWKSGfDM6NxIKh4AaABAg,"This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head
I'm here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life
Then as now fly
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry and then die
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice
We found a breathless paradise
No, we're not dead
No, we're not dead
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you
From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you",Hans S,0,2021-08-25T20:42:00Z

This autumn feels like funeral to me                                      Эта осень словно траур для меня
The longest song of grief.                                                        Бесконечная песня тоски

But for what shall last                                                               А о том что будет впереди

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal.                           Утомлённая природа так трагична и суицидальна
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself.               Как потрясающа она ,когда себя лишает жизни
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes.                       Муки смерти медленно крадутся к пальцам её ног
As the last leaf is falling off her head.                                    Лишь только с головы её последний опадёт листок

I'm here with her undressed.                                                    Я здесь, рядом с ней обнажена                              
With a few petals on my breasts.                                            Лишь на груди два лепестка
We shared opiates and let the  landscapes do the same   Мы делим опиаты ,пейзажам позволяя также поступать
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone      Люблю твоё тепло ,но всё-же предпочту одной в ознобе спать
We fixed our eyes up to the sky                                                Мы устремили наши взгляды в небеса
To see a flight send us farewell                                                И наблюдаем за полётом расставания.

May we see each other next time                                            Возможно мы увидимся опять 
So please                                                                                     Так что ,пожалуйста 
Come back to celebrate this festival of life                            Вернись ,чтоб этот праздник жизни отмечать
Then as now fly.                                                                          И тогда ,как сейчас лети
Today you reached the point of no return                              Сегодня ты достигла точки невозврата
Now cry and then die.                                                                Теперь же плачь и умри
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored               И с восстановленными клетками я встречу тебя завтра

In the name of total reconstruction                                         Во имя полного восстановления
My biggest source of confusion                                              Источник моего недоумения
The reason of decay and disillusion                                       Причина упадка и разочарования

We found a breathless paradise                                              Нашли мы бездыханный рай
No ,we're not dead                                                                     Мы не мертвы

Just enjoying coma.                                                                  Лишь наслаждение комой.

From the ashes of my roots                                                     Из трухи моих корней
The new me will rise to live again                                           Я новая, взойду и снова буду жить

Vivace (Perennial)

[Intro]
Cet automne ressemble plutôt à des funérailles, à mon sens
La plus longue chanson de deuil
Et non pour ce qui n’est plus
Mais pour ce qui doit durer

[Verse 1]
La nature épuisée est si tragique et suicidaire
Oh combien spectaculaire est-elle lorsqu’elle se tue
Les racines de la mort rampent lentement vers ses orteils
Au moment où la dernière feuille tombe de sa tête
Je suis là, avec elle, dévêtue
Avec quelques pétales sur ma poitrine
Nous avons partagé des opiacés et laissé les paysages faire de même
J’aime ta chaleur, mais je préfère néanmoins dormir au froid, seule
Nous avons fixé nos yeux vers le ciel
Pour voir une volée nous faire ses adieux

[Chorus]
Au revoir
Souhaitons que nous nous reverrons la prochaine fois
Alors, s’il te plaît, reviens célébrer ce festival de la vie
Mais pour l’instant, envole-toi
Aujourd’hui, tu as atteint le point de non-retour
Maintenant, pleure et ensuite meurs
Demain, je te retrouverai avec tes cellules restaurées

[Bridge]
Tradition annuelle de destruction de masse
Au nom de la reconstruction totale
Ma plus grande source de confusion
La raison de toute décadence et désillusion
Sous une glace permanente
Nous avons trouvé un paradis à couper le souffle
Non, nous ne sommes pas mortes
Non, nous ne sommes pas mortes
Nous profitons seulement de ce coma

[Outro]
Des cendres de mes racines
La nouvelle moi s’élèvera pour vivre à nouveau
Ceci est poésie de la jeunesse
Ceci est poésie de moi et de toi
Des cendres de mes racines
La nouvelle moi s’élèvera pour vivre à nouveau
Ceci est poésie de la jeunesse
Ceci est poésie de moi et de toi

Btw- i am into weird stuff, like Devin Townsend, but Jinjer sounds generic to me, that's my opinion.
Metal for everyone, seems okay, otherwise isn't it about art and identity ?
Maybe, i'm tooooo old or a hatred elitist 😉...

It's growled at me by a demonic voice and I cannot explain with I find this delightful. And not only are the lyrics dope but the music is on point and masterfully crafted.

Grew somber, Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Yeah, Yeah Yeahs. White Stripes, Chevelle. Peter Gabriel.
Then I heard the Blue Ep from Oceans of Slumber. Vk goes wild and The incredible band called Now Now. Butcher Babies somehow led to Jinjer and here I am. I've been lucky to hear the greatest music in the world. In a short life. Jinjer has been since that piceses vid, that first time she screamed. The most incredible thing I have ever heard.

This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last
Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head
I'm here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone.
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell
Goodbye!
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!
Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored
Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice we found a breathless paradise
No, we're not dead
No, we're not dead
Just enjoying coma
From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth, this is poetry of me and you!

This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head

I'm here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye!
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!

Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice
We found a breathless paradise
No, we're not dead
No, we're not dead
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you!

From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you!",Bruno Arruda,1362,2019-07-19T12:43:52Z

942,UgxKb4l3d_cclmGv_SZ4AaABAg,"This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief.
And not for what has past
But for what shall last.

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head.
I'm here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone.
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye!
May we see each other next time.
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life

Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return.
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored.

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion.
Under permanent ice we found a breathless paradise
No, we're not dead,
No, we're not dead,
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth, this is poetry of me and you!
From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth, this is poetry of me and you!",IamNintendocore,4,2019-06-27T15:38:43Z

This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head

I'm here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye!
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!

Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice
We found a breathless paradise
No, we're not dead
No, we're not dead
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you!

From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you!",Patty CF,0,2019-03-29T15:36:43Z

""Perennial""

Este otoño me parece un funeral.
La canción más larga de pena.
Y no por lo que ha pasado.
Si no por lo que durará.


¡La naturaleza agotada es tan trágica y suicida!
¡Oh, qué espectacular es cuando se mata ella misma!
La agonía se arrastra lentamente a los dedos de sus pies
A medida que la última hoja se cae de su cabeza.


Estoy aquí con ella sin vestir.
Con unos pocos pétalos en mis senos.
Compartimos opiáceos y dejamos que los paisajes hagan lo mismo.
Me encanta tu calor, pero aun prefiero dormir sola en el frío.
Fijamos nuestros ojos hacia el cielo.
Para ver que un vuelo nos despida.


¡Adiós!
Ojalá nos veamos la próxima vez.
Así que por favor, ¡vuelve para celebrar este festival de la vida!


Entonces como ahora vuela!
Hoy has llegado al punto sin retorno.
Ahora llora ¡Y luego muere!
Mañana me reuniré contigo con tus células restauradas.


Tradición anual de destrucción masiva.
En nombre de la reconstrucción total.
Mi mayor fuente de confusión.
La razón de la decadencia y la desilusión.
Bajo hielo permanente encontramos un paraíso que deja sin aliento.
No, no estamos muertos,
No, no estamos muertos,
Solo disfrutando de coma


De las cenizas de mis raíces, la nueva yo se levantará para vivir otra vez.
Esto es poesía de juventud, esto es poesía de mí y de ti.


De las cenizas de mis raíces, la nueva yo se levantará para vivir otra vez.
Esto es poesía de juventud, esto es poesía de mí y de ti.",John M,0,2019-03-03T20:40:56Z
1260,Ugwuvw8kRd9dKY3np4F4AaABAg,"This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief.
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last.
Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head.
I´m here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone.
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell
Goodbye!
May we see each other next time.
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!
Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return.
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored.
Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction.
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion.
Under permanent ice we found a breathless paradise
No, we´re not dead,
No, we´re not dead,
Just enjoying coma
From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth, this is poetry of me and you!",Haitzandi,0,2019-03-03T19:43:08Z

1556,UgyAEL3p-eRGqQKoDX54AaABAg,"This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head
I´m here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life
Then as now fly
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry and then die
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice
We found a breathless paradise
No, we´re not dead
No, we´re not dead
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you
From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you",Steve S,0,2019-01-29T10:30:32Z

1713,Ugw78T3EA6ioENFLf-F4AaABAg,"LYRICS:
This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head
I'm here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life
Then as now fly
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry and then die
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice
We found a breathless paradise
No, we're not dead
No, we're not dead
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you
From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth
This is poetry of me and you",namelessunuser,0,2019-01-20T00:32:55Z

1823,UgyuIKmkZvrQihAemDF4AaABAg,"Стал фанатом Jinjer после того, как увидел Pisces. Я ищу в ваших песнях чего-то похожего - и в этой немного нахожу. Я здесь, пожалуй, ради 3 вещей:
1. Спокойная партия, мелодия, звучание, приятное слуху. 2.Сильная агрессивная партия, максимально контрастирующая со спокойной. 3. Кульминация (Pisces - 4:25)
Я здесь не ради чего-то похожего на Sit Stay Roll Over. Если я буду искать что-то такое, я пожалуй, предпочту Emmure или Heart Of A Coward.
У них есть то, чего нет у Тани - мощнейший, плотнейший !мужской! гроул (У Тани он тоже очень мощный и плотный, но всё равно не мужской).
Зато у вас есть то, чего нет у них - контраст между экстримом и нежным и сильным чистым голосом.
Не понимаю, зачем бороться с титанами на их же поле - когда в вашей власти открыть свою собственную, никем до этого не изведанную, территорию.

This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last
 
Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head
 
I´m here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell
 
Goodbye!
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!
 
Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored
 
Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice
We found a breathless paradise
No, we´re not dead,
No, we´re not dead,
Just enjoying coma
 
From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth,
This is poetry of me and you!
 
From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth,
This is poetry of me and you!",Licen,453,2019-01-15T08:01:16Z

1874,Ugx1CPWwni57O-WdcNB4AaABAg,"Соглашусь со многими: это ваша лучшая песня на данный момент. По крайней мере среди тех, на которые есть видео. Очень нравятся такие тенденции в вашей музыке: больше дэт, чем прогрессив, и при этом мелодик... Есть и жескач, который качает, и одновременно ласкающая слух мелодичность - это двойной удар, просто дабл килл!.. Пожалуйста, делайте больше музыки в таком ключе!
В вокале, как мне показалось, тоже появились изменения, если говорить про чистый: больше планов и нюансов, оттенков и переливов... Ещё красивее, ещё нежнее и проникновеннее, чем прежде...
И всему этому способствует лирика, которая отлично написана, глубокая и погружающая в атмосферу произведения наравне с видео...
Клип заслуживает отдельных слов: насыщенные, выпуклые образы, за которыми из глубины прошедших столетий самим собой тянется шлейф из легенд и мистических историй... Он заставляет разгорячёно работать воображение и самостоятельно дополнять, додумывать повествование, в центре которого его Героиня, в бесконечной череде смертей и воскрешений отождествляемая с Природой, и, то блистающая в своей ослепительной красоте и кружащая в земном водовороте жизней, то увядающая, как поздняя осенняя листва, и стоящая на пороге своей могилы...
И когда это всё соединяется с музыкой, текстом и голосом... Получается очень символично, очень величественно и красиво, брутально, грязно и возвышено одновременно - потрясающая смесь, тянущая на самое изысканное колдовское зелье, которое когда-либо варила украинская группа в истории...

P.S. Особенно мне понравилось, что они здесь используют более стандартную структуру песни. В отличие от ""I Speak Astronomy"", например, 1-ая и 2-ая части которой воспринимаются как 2 отдельные песни, просто соединённые вместе, что мешает моему личному восприятию композиции... А могла бы быть потрясающая работа... Но в существующем виде ""I Speak Astronomy"" воспринимается как демо - незаконченная версия произведения. Или даже сразу 2 демо, записанные в виде какго-то короткого мегамикса... В общем, что-то сырое, какая-то недоделка...",Павел Кудлач,4,2019-01-15T03:34:05Z

Jinjer's lyrics are always really sophisticated, but the meaning of other songs has usually been quite straightforward. This one seems more complex. I can't tell if it is talking about a relationship using the symbolism of Yule as a metaphor, or talking about being connected to nature using the symbolism of romance as a metaphor. This feels like a big step to more complex songwriting that one can mull over and look at from different angles and appreciate on different levels and I'm loving it.",J.F.

As the last leaf is falling off her head
I´m here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye!

May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!

Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!

In the name of total reconstruction

The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice
We found a breathless paradise

This autumn feels like funeral to me
the longest song of grief
and not for what has passed
but for what shall last

Exhausted nature is tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
as the last leaf is falling off her head
I´m here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscaped do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in a cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye!
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!

Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion 
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice we found breathless paradise
No, we´re not dead
No, we´re not dead
just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again",Rafael Kr,2,2019-01-11T14:55:06Z

2470,Ugw7W6P_1KUetONMDI14AaABAg,Absolutely stellar drumming. You can tell when a drummer is playing for the betterment of the song and this guy knows right where it's at with the groove. Killer chops when needed. I love that section with the constant pounding snare with the off kilter guitar riffs. Top notch songwriting from these guys. This is easily a new favorite of mine. I really hope they continue with a more progressive approach like the displayed here. It really makes the heavy parts have so much more impact when the music can breathe in between. 10/10.,blackroseimmortal,367,2019-01-11T13:34:00Z

This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief.
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last.

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is  when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head.

I´m here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone.
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye!
May we see each other next time.
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!

Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return.
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored.

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction.
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion.
Under permanent ice we found a breathless paradise 
No, we´re not dead,
No, we´re not dead,
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again

The longes song of grief.
And not for what has passed,
But for what I shall last.

Exhausted nature is so tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head

I´m here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscapes do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye!
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!
Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice
We found a breathless paradise
No, we´re not dead,
No, we´re not dead,
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots
The new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth,
This is poetry of me and you!﻿",John the shooter,37,2019-01-10T21:39:01Z
