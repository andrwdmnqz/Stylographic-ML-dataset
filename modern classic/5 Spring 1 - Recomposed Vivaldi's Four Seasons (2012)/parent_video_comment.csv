7,Ugz0z_wLDkZB8_fTyM54AaABAg,"I recently heard this song, while watching the movie, 'The Current War,' & it sounded so profoundly beautiful & yet so familiar that I had to find out what it was called & who made it at the film's ending credits, & the song's title sounded so familiar, that I didn't even have to write its name or the name of the man who composed it, I remembered it, Max Richter. Even days later, I couldn't get the song out of my head, I had to find out more about it & the man was who made such a wonderful work or auditory art. Now, I love it even more than Vivaldi's original, which I never thought could be possible, & hardly recognize it...it is so...breathtakingly beautiful, that the word, ""Beautiful,"" barely begins to describe it; so amazing in its wonder.",Nathan Holton,2,2022-02-27T11:23:14Z
