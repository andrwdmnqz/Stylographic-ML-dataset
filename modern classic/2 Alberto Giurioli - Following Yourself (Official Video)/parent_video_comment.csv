78,UgzkZdBrJboE9klx1AF4AaABAg,"For some odd reason, this piece brings a very specific sequence of thoughts and visions into my mind.

I imagine myself navigating an abstract world of ideas and memories. Kind of like that Interstellar scene, but weirder. I recall travelling this exact path once before, a long time ago, and I remember how wrong I was about everything. I was selfish, unaware and inconsiderate. This hurt a lot of people, including myself.

Now I'm at the beginning of this path again. I remember the movements my former self made, I see the ugly consequences of these movements, but I'm resolved to change it all, to change myself. This time I'm doing it right. I follow myself, restlessly, street after street, rooftop after rooftop, fixing my errors, doing things over, over and over until they are done right, fighting my past self, learning the right way and, finally, coming out into the light, into a better world, which I have created around me.

I hope this makes some kind of sense. It is half imagined, half true, and it resonates with me deeply along with this track you have created, parts of it clearly connecting to parts of my little story up there. I guess you could say this is the definition of a masterpiece - something that transcends the boundaries of a single mind and makes someone else think, feel and do unexplainable, but meaningful things.

Thank you, Alberto.",Alexey Agapov,1,2019-07-10T19:20:59Z

We live in this sad world filled with technology but ignore the main casualty, that being the loss of human connection, its compassion and wonder. At times we just seem to be passing through a life lived on a 4 x6 inch screen.  With music I wish at times people would close their eyes if just for a moment, open their heart and mind to the subtle nuances, beauty of the melody, its rhythm and the power of each note. Let the moment be only about themselves and hearing the playing of the artist and what they feel. Then with love share it with others because it was a truly unique experience, they truly felt the moment and wanted others to feel the beauty and warmth they felt...Your music was heart felt and beautiful..  For me Music is like a painting on the canvas of the listeners heart, you always capture that..
