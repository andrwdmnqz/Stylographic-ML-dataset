I heard your music first time with a meditation from ‚Äú you are creators‚Äù, a piece of Devenire... this was only about 3 months ago and couldn‚Äôt stop to listen. About a month I found your name and took from Apple Music everything I could... I cannot stop ... I love good music... your music isn‚Äôt good... it is Devine! And a week ago imagining my new home I saw a piano and also saw agile hands playing... I asked who owns these hands? The answer was the author of the ‚Äúmusic‚Äù, the music is Devenire!!!
It was you playing in my house!üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüAfter that I was curious to see the author and started to research about you. Now I follow you in YouTube, Twitter. Looked for concerts and it will be one in Z√ºrich where I live on April 3rd, also in Luzern which is very close and also possible to go but both sold out! It will be another opportunity or it will be a way to be open a special door and I‚Äôll be there and see you personally! 
Thank you for your music!
Thank you for being used by God to spread all this love!
All this beautiful energyüåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª, God bless you!

2) The [Son] is you, the [Father] is your father
3) play video


[Son]
You know, living with you, it hasn‚Äôt been easy. People see me but they think of you. Now, with all this going on, it‚Äôs gonna be worse than ever.

[Father]
It doesn‚Äôt have to be.

[Son] Source: LYBIO.net
Sure it does!

[Father]
Why? You‚Äôve got a lot going on, kid.

[Son]
What, my last name? That‚Äôs the reason I got a decent job. That‚Äôs the reason why people deal with me in the first place. Now I start to get a little ahead. I start to get a little something for myself, and this happens. Now, I‚Äôm asking you as a favor not to go through with this, okay. This is gonna end up bad for you, and it‚Äôs gonna end up bad for me.

[Father]
You think I‚Äôm hurting you?

[Son]
Yeah, in a way, you are.

[Father]
That‚Äôs the last thing I ever wanted to do.

[Son]
I know that‚Äôs not what you wanna do, but that‚Äôs just the way that it is. Don‚Äôt you care what people think? Doesn‚Äôt bother you that people‚Ä¶are making you out to be joke and that I‚Äôll be included in that? Do you think that‚Äôs right? Do you?

[Father] Source: LYBIO.net
You ain‚Äôt gonna believe this, but you used to fit right here.

I‚Äôd hold you up to say to your mother, ‚ÄúThis kid‚Äôs gonna be the best kid in the world. This kid‚Äôs gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew.‚Äù And you grew up good and wonderful. It was great just watching you, every day was like a privilege. Then the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world, and you did. But somewhere along the line, you changed. You stopped being you. You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you‚Äôre no good. And when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame, like a big shadow.

Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows. It‚Äôs a very mean and nasty place and I don‚Äôt care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain‚Äôt about how hard ya hit. It‚Äôs about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That‚Äôs how winning is done! Now if you know what you‚Äôre worth then go out and get what you‚Äôre worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain‚Äôt where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain‚Äôt you! You‚Äôre better than that!

I‚Äôm always gonna love you no matter what. No matter what happens. You‚Äôre my son and you‚Äôre my blood. You‚Äôre the best thing in my life. But until you start believing in yourself, ya ain‚Äôt gonna have a life.",Gourmet Burger,0,2019-02-20T17:12:23Z

Since that video was made in 2013, I was looking through your songs from 2013.
