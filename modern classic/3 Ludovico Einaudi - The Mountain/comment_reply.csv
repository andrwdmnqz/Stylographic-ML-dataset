2,UgwWMftTtoM_daq_z5h4AaABAg,MoosesValley,"@FMNsocial It was a news report on TSO Photography when they created the time lapse from photos they took all around the mountai in Spain.  Just tried to find the news report - checked TSO Photography's Facebook and YouTube channel - not linked there, why ???   Also did a bunch of searches, but no luck so far.  Will keep searching and report back when I find it.",2022-04-19T12:07:37Z,1

13,UgifcScU14rq2XgCoAEC,Henrik Larsson,"Just because we have God in our life and put our trust in the rock of ages, Jesus Christ, does not mean we can¬¥t have sad times, depression nor anything else. Most of the prophets cried and lamented for their people all the time, and they were the ambassadors for God! Look at the book of lamentations. Just a look at this sad fallen world and it¬¥s evils can break your heart. Yet he will give peace in the heart to those who follow him. Stay strong in his word, repent, pray, fast, and set your eyes on his kingdom, because it¬¥s not of this world! 
""Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable‚Äîif anything is excellent or praiseworthy‚ÄîTHINK on these things.""
