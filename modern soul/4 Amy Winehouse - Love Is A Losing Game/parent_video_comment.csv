6,UgzjNIUPLdEeX5MDKMh4AaABAg,"Aside from the back to black song. This is the one that pulled my heart strings. Look at me as I sit here and write my comments I get tears coming out still after she's been gone 10 years. I loved this Artist not in a physical way
 But the way her life  unfolded and how she dealt with her addiction and her relationship but still had a way to never let her fans know that her music was not gonna let it affect them because of her personal misfortunes. She poured  her heart and inner soul in all her music and that's why I loved her so much. We probably  will never seen another gem like her. Yeah man she was that fucking good RIP mama.

36,UgzyshkO2Q8Dp7MS_6d4AaABAg,"Per te ero una fiamma 
For you, I was a flame 

L'amore √® un gioco perdente 
Love is a losing game 

Fuoco di cinque piani come sei venuto 
Five-storey fire as you came 

L'amore √® un gioco perdente
Love is a losing game
Uno che vorrei non aver mai giocato 
One I wish I never played 

Oh, che casino abbiamo fatto 
Oh, what a mess we made 

E ora, il fotogramma finale 
And now, the final frame 

L'amore √® un gioco perdente
Love is a losing game
Suonato dalla band 
Played out by the band 

L'amore √® una mano perdente 
Love is a losing hand 

Pi√π di quanto potrei sopportare 
More than I could stand 

L'amore √® una mano perdente
Love is a losing hand
Autodichiarato, profondo 
Self-professed, profound 

Fino a quando le patatine non sono finite 
'Til the chips were down 

Sappi che sei un uomo d'azzardo 
Know you're a gambling man 

L'amore √® una mano perdente
Love is a losing hand
Anche se combatto alla cieca 
Though I battle blind 

L'amore √® un destino rassegnato 
Love is a fate resigned 

I ricordi rovinano la mia mente 
Memories mar my mind 

Amore, √® un destino rassegnato
Love, it is a fate resigned
Oltre inutili probabilit√† 
Over futile odds 

E deriso dagli dei 
And laughed at by the gods 

E ora il fotogramma finale 
And now the final frame 

L'amore √® un gioco perdente",Gaetano Maurizio Grippi,0,2022-04-14T06:13:49Z

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods

Salir de una adicci√≥n no es una tarea f√°cil y comprobamos por medio de √©ste ejemplo o el de Whitney, que ni con todo el dinero el mundo, salir de una adicci√≥n sea cual sea, es algo que va m√°s all√° del dinero. Es una disfuci√≥n y s√≥lo los que padecemos una adicci√≥n, sabemos que viene una mounstruosa enfermedad llamada depresi√≥n. De que sirve la fama si no somos felices?

Yo pensaba que si...
Pero me he equivocado, porque sigo igual, o peor a cuando no tenia una buena posici√≥n..

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods

I was sitting on the couch as usual, ready to end the week with a relaxed movie night as suddenly for whatever reason the youtube algorithm proposed me to click a music video by Amy Winehouse. 

Of course by that time I was aware of her, some famous singer, same age as me, drug addict, who shouted out loud she would never go to rehab and finally died at young age. For sure I've known some of her songs from the radio as well, but actually didn¬¥t see any reason at all to further approach her music. 

Before choosing the movie for the night I anyway clicked on that proposed video, just like clicking on thousands of others for no particular purpose.

That Friday movie night ended on Saturday morning, 2am, after watching 6 hours in a row one Amy Winehouse video after the other. I have never had such a mind-blowing experience related to music in my entire life. I can truly say I got addicted that day. 


Thank you so much for enriching my life, Amy! üíö",Thomas Goetz,3,2022-01-04T19:52:51Z

She‚Äôs a smiling girl outside where everyone can see her physically‚Ä¶ but that girl inside is just in a fetal position‚Ä¶ staring off blankly slowly crying‚Ä¶. Just makes you want to hug the fuck out of her and treat her the way she wants to be loved and treated unconditionally.. such a broken soul‚Ä¶ I would have loved to have smoked a bowl of weed with her.. just chill on our instruments and just talk about how fucked up life was.. just to relate and not only let her know that she‚Äôs not alone.. but that none of us were alone. This woman would walk on the side of a fucking sidewalk and just casually talk amongst her friends or people who said hey to her. She had a posh accent and was really just like the rest of us who we consider normal and not celebrities. Even had a wicked sense of humor ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚Ä¶ it sucks she‚Äôs gone cause I really feel her at this phase in my life right now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so relatable and raw emotion‚Ä¶. You don‚Äôt really find that in many artist today.. she was a phenomena and force to be reckoned with.. I send you my love and peace, Amy. I hope you‚Äôre resting in peace. This is the only way I can feel like I‚Äôm talking to you even though you‚Äôre gone but still so relevant. Definitely not forgotten. I have so much respect for your style of writing music. It‚Äôs fucking poetry.. trauma‚Ä¶ love‚Ä¶ life‚Ä¶. A work of art‚Ä¶ Music‚Ä¶ this is the definition of Impressionism. She was bringing that back when she was rising in fame. It‚Äôs what she should have total recognition for. God‚Ä¶ who woulda thought Jazz mixed with Pop‚Ä¶ when you think about it‚Ä¶ it makes so much fucking sense. I would laugh my ass off if anyone walked up to a fountain and pretended they were peeing üòÇ(video footage in documentary). It‚Äôs just kind of my sense of humor. I got that vibe getting to know you through things like that. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt even quote that to her, cause I‚Äôd really would have liked to have known her just as a person. She seems like an amazing friendship to make with someone who could be pivotal in your life. We got a lot of friends, but we have those few who are the ones that are true friends. Rest In Peace love.. I only wish it wasn‚Äôt too late to say hey to you. That will be a world wonder some of us will never know. üíãüé§üéµ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§",Tc725,2,2021-10-01T04:18:47Z

For you, I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five-storey fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now, the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game",Jhon Jairo,0,2021-09-06T04:13:29Z

Love is a losing game
Five-storey fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wish I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now, the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game",Mon,0,2021-08-24T21:17:35Z

Die Liebe ist ein Spiel, bei dem es nur Verlierer gibt

Ausgespielt von der Band,
Die Liebe ist ein Blatt, das verliert
Mehr als ich ertragen kann,
Die Liebe ist ein Blatt, das verliert


Selbsterkl√§rt tiefsinnig,
Bis die Chips alle liegen [2],
Auch wenn du ein Spieler-Typ bist,
Die Liebe ist ein Blatt, das verliert

Auch wenn ich blind war,
Liebe ist ein Spiel mit dem Schicksal,
Erinnerungen qu√§len mich,
Liebe ist ein Spiel mit dem Schicksal.

Mit l√§cherlich geringen Siegchancen,
Ausgelacht von den G√∂ttern,
Und jetzt der letzte Stand,
Die Liebe ist ein Spiel, bei dem es nur Verlierer gibt",Roxannah,0,2021-06-30T19:53:33Z

reminded me how my dear late mom loved ü•∞ Amy and
her singing‚Ä¶..so terribly sad üò¢ what a waste‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
I understand addiction in the sense that I am now a recovering 
alcoholic‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and for certain people like Amy it must have been
extremely hard being prone to substance abuse AND in the public eye!!
which many of us are NOT!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶she was and LOOKED vulnerable I think and did not have many
people around her who were GENUINE‚Ä¶‚Ä¶they simply took advantage and used her
for their own gain üò°üí∞üíµ so common with extremely talented famous individuals!
Such a shame it seems that NOBODY could actually take her away to ‚Äòrecover‚Äô for
much longer than these so called rehab stints!! She needed a LOT of time to sort out the demons
and stinking thinking in her head! And she was only young‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢

'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man

816,UgwfvWoCqKH-2ouT8bR4AaABAg,"Amy winehouse reminds me of the Greatest of all time Whitney Houston. They both are legends and they both didn't know how brilliant they really were. When Whitney died   I was reading all the comments from artists in a magazine all saying how great she was and how she's the greatest but the one that was most striking to me was Barbara Streisand who said ""Whitney was magnificent, how sad her gifts couldn't bring her the same happiness they brought us"".

 With that said, during Amy Winehouse‚Äôs career there was not one single of hers I heard on the radio that I enjoyed. I can‚Äôt tell you why but I just didn‚Äôt enjoy them at all.
 HOWEVER, having come here from a video interview with Bill Bailey who was asked which song he can‚Äôt listen to, and he said he can‚Äôt hear this song without crying, I have to admit I can see where he‚Äôs coming from.
 This song is (again, in my personal opinion) infinitely better than her singles, and I remember hearing a song of hers in my first job (although I couldn‚Äôt tell you the name of it) that damn near lulled me to sleep because it was so soulful, so chilled, so soothing. It was beautiful and I really wish I knew what it was called.

Makes me want to look into her back catalogue and see what other absolute gems I‚Äôve missed.

Edit: I‚Äôve since discovered that this was a single but didn‚Äôt chart as well as the ones I remember, which is likely why I never heard it.",The Samsquatch,0,2021-03-24T00:45:12Z

968,UgyCOPx8l96Jz7dLo4B4AaABAg,"Love, between men and women, is almost invariably a losing game, as all games are. Evermore of one as the expectation of both are evermore unrealistic. Genuine friendship and natural respect can be gained. However, if the people involved, seriously expect the relationship to be anything notably more than a devotion to the procreation and nurturing of children then best not to start in the first place.
Love is the answer all right. But not the romantic type, indeed if it has anything to do with having sex, then it is not love, you only think it is. We look for love in the wrong places, give it to the wrong people, for the wrong reasons and wonder why we lose what we never had in the first place.",Gary Powell,2,2021-03-22T17:17:38Z

1005,UgwXTjBIuEC54-Kqlqp4AaABAg,"I remember travelling into London with my mum and brother when I was about 14 or 15 years old. When we got into London, not far from islington/highbury area, the traffic was slow but flowing with a stop start rhythm. As we were gradually edging towards the front of a queue that was caused by a set of traffic lights, a beautiful girl that was sitting and waiting at a bus stop to the left of me caught my eye. I couldn't help but stare at her as she sat there and gaze towards the sky, in her own world. Looking at her I could see that her carefree head was in the clouds just watching the day go past. 

She then turned her head and noticed me staring at her, we made eye contact. As we paused in that brief but beautiful moment, eyes locked looking at one another, we shared a beautiful subtle smile before breaking into a full on contagious beaming smile, as if we were good friends sharing a private joke and all the passersby were none the wiser.

I thought ""wow look how beautiful she is and what a gorgeous smile"" and then blushingly I turned my gaze away, not wanting to make it awkward for myself nor her.

Then I thought to myself ""Hold on! Was that?!""

I snapped my neck back and realised, Yes! it was indeed Amy Winehouse! She started laughing realising that I had processed, computed and only just clocked on. 

I exclaimed to my brother ""look!! that's Amy Winehouse there!""  He was more focused on the road and the lights up ahead as they began to change green he didnt believe me anyway.  

As the car started moving I quickly put my windows down and shouted ""AMY!!"" She looked and was laughing even harder and then I knew without doubt it was her.

The cars moved off and my moment with her had passed.

I still think of that moment, especially when I go into London, as I usually go past the exact same spot. I think what if I would have got out the car and just took my shot at striking a conversation with her. Just to connect with another human and interact before going on about our days and lives. 

She had a beautiful smile. And I can still picture her in that moment.",Snypa_FX,2207,2021-03-10T04:14:59Z

Why do I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed... profound
Till the chips were down
...know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I'm rather blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind

In Ephesians @1:13, Apostle Paul says, ‚ÄúIn him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit when you heard the word of the truth, and when you believed.‚Äù That is the gospel of your salvation=that you‚Äôre putting your faith and trust in Jesus Christ and His finished work on the cross. Jesus took all sins on the cross, died, was buried, and on the 3rd day He rose again! That is your gospel of salvation! It‚Äôs in the Scripture. Jesus paid all of your sin debt on that cross, taking your place so that you can be forgiven and be reunited with Him forever! Jesus is the ONLY one who can save you from everything in this world and beyond! 

After you have put your faith and trust in the gospel of your salvation and believed in Jesus, you have been sealed by the Holy Spirit ~ (Ephesians @1:13). You are sealed by the Holy Spirit until the day of redemption! Nobody can take that away from you! I encourage you to accept this free gift of salvation from God through His Son Jesus Christ, the true Lord and Savior of the world! Please, give Jesus a chance to be with you! Don‚Äôt be left astray, reconnect with God through Jesus! Nobody can go to God before going through Jesus! GOD CARES ABOUT YOU SO MUCH that He gave His ONLY SON to us!

Love Is A Losing Game is, in my opinion, the absolute BEST song on this work and that is saying something...she was an absolute genius but seriously flawed and this song, probably more so among most of her catalogue, portrays these failings best...written at an amazingly young of 23, it nevertheless projects a profoundly adult experience with love lost and hurt all within a magical musical cacophony. Indeed, I virtually listened to this in my entire drive from Stephenville, Texas to Waco, Texas in early 2011 when going to my daughter's Senior Volleyball game (about 2 hours)...I couldn't get enough!!! When she died in July of that year, I really wasn't sad, I was more frustrated...was I the only one who saw this coming?!?!?

When she first hit the scene, I dug her because I'm all about music from the '60's.  But I quickly lost interest because of the drama surrounding her.  now I'm trying to re-discover her.   She's got a story that runs parallel to other tormented female singers like Janis.  It doesn't hurt to believe in a higher being, to believe that a Creator knows you and loves you.  You have to love yourself, but we fail at that too.  I wish she would have fallen in love with Jesus.  She would've been a heck of a gospel singer.",MattHatter,0,2020-07-22T22:17:30Z

A lot of other artists (Adele, Lady Gaga etc) do cite her as an influence but i still feel they fit into the more traditional pop sound of the age.

Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Memories mar my mind

Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man

Memories mar my mind

2167,UgwZ6cPn-6yKasWhR1J4AaABAg,"The quiet resignation of this song haunts me. As a 50+ yr old (boomer, yeah) the most relevant band in my teen years was Joy Division, and I can sense a link between Amy's album Back To Black and JD's 'Closer'. The same sort of terrible resignation to fate haunts it, as if the singer's fate is alrready sealed, she was just appointed to it without having a choice. I also think Amy was basically a nice woman, it comes across in her interviews. I recall watching clips of her making cups of tea for journos and giving them jaffa cakes outside her house in Camden. Little things like that stay with me. It's just too bad. Maybe the best pop musicians have to live on the edge and burn out, I dunno. I couldn't do that myself, but then again I'll never write songs like this, so I really don't know what to say except RIP, and thank you for this music that makes me feel alive.",579enact,0,2020-01-31T00:51:39Z

Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game

One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
Though I battled blind

Memories mar my mind

And as it came to the end and I was exchanging impressions with my husband, I broke into tears. She was a victim of different events and how things played out in her life. I cried for her and the young force of life she was and how a series of poorly made decisions lead to her end. It breaks my heart and I still can't get used to the fact that she's gone.",Aurora Madariaga,0,2019-07-27T17:56:26Z

Love is losing game
One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game",miihaillistx,3,2019-06-10T11:17:02Z

One I wished, I never played

And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game.

Love is a losing hand

Look again at what you have created. See what you create. Every day you create the God you seek. Every way you choose your reality conjures the exact projection of what your intentions were.

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed, profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I'm rather blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods

Hey guys, this is super random but can we start taking care of each other? Can we start being advocates for mental health? If your heart is heavy right now and you're thinking of giving up, please remember that every rope has an end. it doesn't matter how dark or how terrible your situation is, it will come to an end..Time heals everything.

3539,UgxmBPLCf3OIWiPhSz14AaABAg,when you fall in love so deeply. You now the relationship is not good but you don't want to loose the little that you have left. You loose yourself trying to become what he wants so he won't go away. now that you bubble is burst and reality hits you. You dont know where to escape because you pilled yourself with so much pain. Love is a loosing game. yes it is and sadly i don't see how im loosing if im the one who fought for this relationship for so many years. maybe another player joined the game and i never noticed. Hope next time you loose so you can feel my pain. Tears of pain that consume my joy and happiness. Thanks to you i turned into a dark person who nobody can see and neither i can see my own shadow. where have i gone? I don't know. will i someday find myself? i don't know. I lost myself to find you. I'm screaming my name hoping I will apoear someday. Love is a losing game.,Ana Benito Nicolas,0,2018-07-20T19:49:50Z

Bien s√ªr, c'est ton droit
pour me laisser tomber. Mais je pense que c'est m√©chant et stupide.
Je suis une femme, une femme moderne. Je ne serai pas emprisonn√©, je ne serai pas humili√© - je suis moi et je veux t'aimer tel que je suis.

Laissez-moi √™tre appr√©ci√©, mes adorateurs et confiance en Dieu, que personne n'est comme vous! Je ne supporterai pas ta haine et ta col√®re,

For you I was the flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game

One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed, profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Tho I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game",Paulina Hofmann,43,2018-01-20T14:28:46Z

Love is losing game
One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame

Five story fire as you came, love is a losing game
One I wished I never played, oh what a mess we made

Played out by the band, love is a losing hand
More than I could stand, love is a losing hand
Self-professed, profound, 'til the tips were down
Know you're a gambling man, love is a losing hand

Though I'm rather blind, love is a fair resign
Memories mar my mind, love it is a fair resign
Over a few tiles, and laughter by the docks

Love is a losing hand

Self professed... profound
Till the chips were down

How bloody sad is that - but I¬†believe, ""THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING - THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CHANCE.""¬† Maybe¬†it's¬†not about ""how we leave¬†this earthly plane¬†but what we¬†leave behind"" and with Amy Winehouse we have her music to listen to forever and to¬†comfort us in our time of need.

Love is a losing game

One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game",Ingrid ayerdis,11,2016-09-02T14:55:21Z

Lyrics
For you I was the flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game

One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game",Y P,0,2016-08-22T20:10:47Z

I always used to like the song, obviously that's why I had it in my playlist, but I never really paid too much attention. However on that day, Saturday 23rd of July, for whatever reason I couldn't stop listening to the song. I started watching more videos and reading about her. Only then I realised it was her death anniversary that day. It felt strange. Amy, was your spirit really around?

It's as if her soul came back from a different time to finish  writing the last songs of the sixties the age of Aquarius. I want to add though that I now believe Amy was a Twin Flame! She even says so in this very song. ""For you I was a Flame"" This she wrote before there were any Twin Flame help videos on you tube. The way her love story played out, the intensity of her love for this guy, the tortured nature of the connection the fact that she loved him in spite of every thing unconditionally all of it! Maybe if she had access to the information things would have been different. All and all I think she did complete her mission she left us these songs......she left us her love story!

Till the chips were down
...know you're a gambling man

Ok I truly feel like God was actually giving us a taste and an actual feel of what REAL music was like in the 60s you know the feelings you get when you listen to Janis Joplin or Jimi Hendrix. I genuinely feel like who Amy was as a person, the way she dressed, how much pain she had in her voice when she sang, the fact that she didn't even want  to be so famous she just wanted to write music, and it's crazy but even the way she passed away it's such a 60s and 70s style. I always tell myself when you hear her music it doesn't sound like a song from this generation it sounds like a timeless classic from 1960 or something. There will never be another like Amy Winehouse but she has opened a door for so many other artists like Lana Del Ray and Adele  and I just want to thank you God for letting us feel that real, raw,painful deep 60s feel of music from Amy one last time that we can keep forever and I miss her so much.

Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed... profound
Till the chips were down
...know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed... profound
Till the chips were down
...know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods

Played out by the band

More than I could stand 
Love is a losing hand 

Self professed profound 
Till the chips were down 
Know you're a gambling man 
Love is a losing hand 

Though I battle blind

Memories mar my mind 
Love is a fate resigned

I am pursuing a career in music as a Singer-Songwriter. I love to listen to music and I am going to listen to all your work, Amy. Listen to this, Amy (Where ever you are: You know what I mean, even when your spirit is awaken and you happen to gaze to my bedroom window and happen to pass through my bedroom window of mine and read my message, which is exactly, why you will be right here with me and standing right next to me (Your ghost) and see what I'm writing on the message, Peep This, Check it:

Amy Winehouse = My Long-Lost Sister

Amy Winehouse, My Long-Lost Sister that never haven't seen in years, one day when I die I will see her ghost and soul in heaven, one day when I die: I will see my long-lost sister in Heaven or Hell - or where ever she is right now. Amy Winehouse - Super-Good Singer-Songwriter. Amy, never in my years, I am saying: Amy You opened my eyes when I heard you sang on stage and plus around the world, tears from eyes, crying every day of my life, I miss you Amy <3, I miss you Sis, I will see you One day - when that day comes, I will fly high in the sky and see you Amy!
Until that day comes, it will arrive to my time. Amy, I will never give up on what I want in my life - Amy, I'm a High-School/University Graduate and I will pursue my 2 careers that will be going to: Computer man and Singer-Songwriter. I will be working full-time and working for long hours to get where I want to be in my future. Plus I will be living and working on my own, then go through all of the necessary important objectives that I will do in life. As a Computer man, I will work on my computer work, like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and other software to work on to the future use, then for my Singer-Songwriter career, I've done all of my work, singing and writing songs, then I will learn how to play piano and guitar, plus all of my songs I've wrote all by myself and I will collaborate with other Singer-Songwriters as well too. When, I get a music award for any type of music genre: like Pop, R&B, Soul, Reggae and Jazz plus more - I will dedicate my first award to you - AMY - FOR YOU, I will be crying and you will see me - knowing you would be there - You as the ghost - I see - Onlysee you in my eyes, never, ever, ever, ever - have I've seen anybody sing, dance and write like you, nobody can't ever replace you because you know why, tell me why, tell you why, I'll tell you why. Amy your voice is the one of the most passionate, sweet, fiery and open throughout the entire world.

The song tender and soft as the soul itself
Consumed by the notes, but
Deceived¬†by love, for there is no
No way-out for a¬†broken heart,¬†the
Music plays on and on¬†like
Some¬†ghost melody¬†on an old carousel
Spinning¬†out of control, still
The crowd call out for more
Chanting, screaming as
The nerves of steel break at their seams
The voice of the angel
Cry for love; but no one hears
No one sees, no one cares
Lost, forever lost within¬†the truth
She bleeds alone within¬†
The solitude of a¬†song,¬†and in the
End it is the song itself¬†that
Claim the prize..

And you know that the remarkable feeling Amy instils in you is just going to be with you until you die. This is the magical power that Amy had over us, we that loved her and that sweet husky, ethereal, special voice. I will never cease to wonder at how she used to make me feel, how she touched me deeply, and how I lost something in my life when she passed away.

'A poem for Amy'



EMERALD EYES
¬†
¬†
¬†
Your eyes speak without words ; reveling the
Deep secrets of overwhelming pain.. I
Have seen this blank stare within
The stars above ; they hold the key to
Many a life's mystery.. If I were granted but¬†just
One wish I would spend it on you and
Set you free from this sorrow.. you
Carry the soul of ten thousand years and
The heart reserved for a child,
Pure, clean, untainted.. your
Emerald eyes hold many a secret like
The ancient scroll before you.. they are the
Windows to your soul reveling your deepest
Sorrow and emotion., the savior awaits you with
Open arms.. as time draws near I
Close these eyes for the last time to
Enter a new beginning.. no more pain, no
More suffering or sorrow to consume me; I
Am now far from the world I once new, my
Mission now complete ; I
Am at last one with peace.. for
These emerald eyes are no longer in pain..

How she touched me deeply, and how I lost something in my life when she passed away. I know that I'm not the only one that feels this way.

I never saw anyone write with the passion you have, just reading your lyrics sometimes instead of singing them really moves me. I will love you tomorrow and forever my eternal butterfly. I will listen to you all day and cherish my generation's billie holiday. We love you and miss you dearly.",anthill927,1,2014-07-23T14:25:37Z

Till the chips were down
Know youre a gambling man

Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed, profound
Till the chips were down
Know youre a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though Im rather blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods

7759,Ugwx8KqCEiU7-6VaDcp4AaABAg,"Tragically, but not without poetic value, Amy seemed to self-author her own obituary in the course of her short life. The video to this song is so posthumously postured, almost as if it were being sung by a woman who had resigned herself to the inevitability of her fate. The song, sung as it were, from beyond the grave. 

Truly gifted. A fully formed genius. She bore truth, beauty & honesty on her young shoulders. Perhaps a burden too great for her. Sometimes, genius can't contain itself.

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind

Over futile odds

""Love Is A Losing Game""

For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed... profound
Till the chips were down
...know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

'The accompanying crap' was her life, from which she drew inspiration for her brilliant songs.
I never think of her as a mess. I think of her as someone who felt things very deeply. One result of that was her songs. The other result of that was her need to self-medicate with drink or drugs. She was just a deeply feeling person who took the time and energy and generosity to turn that pain into gold, to enrich our lives. I'll always be so thankful to her for doing that.

I loved her the moment I heard NO NO NO,  Long overdue is her soulful style of song and voice.  Not afraid to develop her own unique style and individuality either.  I happen to know (being older) how extremely difficult the negatives in life can be,  'It'  seems to be universally designed to find  our weakness and like a thief in the night, if we let down our guard for a bit too long, so very subtly we become enslaved.  For many souls, climbing back out is far too much to endure.    ",Mysti Kissler,0,2011-11-22T13:00:01Z

This song was the very first one that I ever heard from Amy Winehouse and it instantly caught my attention. I loved the 1960's Motown sound to it and the lyrics are just as you said: haunting--and not just that but songwriting at it's best. There is more to Amy than ""Rehab"" which I know is her signature tune and ""Love Is A Losing Game"" shows another side of Amy, along with ""Back To Black"". Rehab is a fun song with a catchy beat but this song is . . . . PROFOUND. ",MusicLoverBrian1,0,2011-08-28T04:55:28Z

And you would think Amy Winehouse would have that ""oh, look my vocal register"" when she sings b/c she has such amazing vocals & you know that she can give you more out of that voice of hers but she brings enough to the table in relation to the song.

Love Is A Losing Game was the first Amy Winehouse song that I ever heard and I heard it a few years ago way before she died. I was instantly hooked to the song because it sounded so different from the music that I hear today--sounds more like a song from the 1960's Motown era (which is an era of music that I really love). The lyrics, the musical arrangement, and Amy Winehouse's voice are just flawless. There is nothing in that song that I can point out and say is bad. ",MusicLoverBrian1,0,2011-08-26T05:15:52Z

It's sad that it takes a tragic incident like this to recognize true talent but Amy's death which is quite sad in its own right has oddly created something positive.

10360,UgwCVc4DLqU42Hymatp4AaABAg,"""Love Is Losing Game"" is pure poetry, haunting, a song that is full of simplicity yet its meaning is complex and it takes a talent songwriter to do that. It's a beautiful tune with a 1960's Motown retro feel to it yet still has that modern sound to it which is quite unique. This song should defintely be a classic down the annals of history because aside from the beautiful, poetic lyrics, the meaning of the song is relevant for the 21st century and many centuries ahead.

I really wish Amy did sing a theme song for a James Bond film. It would defintely would have meant alot and would have left quite an imprint for her legacy but unfortunately her personal problems got in the way of her accomplishing this amazing feat. Though she never recorded a Bond theme, her legacy is still as rich & fertile with the material that she released. I hope to hear some unreleased songs & demos that she left behind, including her latest duet with Tony Bennett.",MusicLoverBrian1,0,2011-08-16T20:07:03Z

But we see that often how bad relationships are very addictive.

It's because their bad boyfriend plays with their mind..making them believe they can't go on without them.
Amy was a victim of being in a relationship with one of those men who mindfucks.
