She's probably overrated because of her young death, yes  but shes way more than a ""good artist"", I think she was exceptional, her voice was unique (there was no Adele).

My honest view though is that Amy's issues with addiction, fame and self control would have most likely manifested outcomes we see time and again generally... poor creative output, poor live performances, poor self-care leading to all kinds of health issues. She was on a path to self destruction, surrounded by people who all used her (a la Britney Spears in broad sense). She was destined to implode or fade away.

I was in London with my 2 almost grown up children in the late 90ies to show them the place where I had met their father.
We were rumbling through town, taking small streets to get a feel of the town, when we stood in front of a shop discussing
if we need something. When suddenly this dude came out, looking like a schoolboy, with shorts and white socks. Then by
looking at his face I realised that it was Elton John. I wanted to ask him to take a photo, but my son held me back, saying, 
those people get annoid by people like us. So I just enjoyed the moment.",2022-04-03T22:13:59Z,0

I started my journey at 13 and just turned 49. It's getting worse and wonder why I wake up every day. I should just give up because eveyone wants to see you fall.

451,UgzqObizF1itOqtZDhB4AaABAg,David Copson,"@Danni Jeppesen Okay. Just listened to the song you referred to and have to say it's not the same song at all. It's not just a question of changed lyrics, the melody is not the same as Amy's song. The only similarity is in the title. It's possible Amy was inspired by this title but that's it. No wonder Tim Christensen was not credited as a writer; this is a completely different song. Sorry. Wishful thinking on your part?",2021-03-23T14:20:23Z,0
452,UgzqObizF1itOqtZDhB4AaABAg,David Copson,"@Danni Jeppesen Okay, that's interesting. I'll check it out. The sleeve notes for Back to Black should though credit Christensen, which they don't do. Then again, 'Fight Test' by The Flaming Lips does the same thing. This song is clearly derived from Cat Stevens' Father and Son but makes no mention of the original in the song writing credits (again, the words were changed but the melody was the same).
