18,UgwJWat0typO6-fS_sN4AaABAg,ag,"An extra layer to this topic btw, is that internet algorithms also prioritise controversial or sensationalist content over educational and factual content, because it tends to get more clicks. The whole clickbait thing. This heavily weights the balance in favour of fringe beliefs even more. It is an issue with TV and Newspapers too, with the news media putting sensationalist stories at the forefront for ratings. But the problem has only gotten worse with the internet, where anyone can say anything without any accountability, and lies spread like wildfire (hence why people were already on edge about covid misinformation before Joe Rogan started to contribute to it.) So this is another reason why people are calling for more accountability from companies like Spotify (and social media in general) to adjust algorithms such that they don't only favour what is sensationalist (and therefore profitable) but also are responsible platforms that try to push educational content, not just controversy that further divides our society and fractures our unity (to where we can't even agree on basic universal truths anymore.)",2022-02-05T20:08:13Z,1
19,UgwJWat0typO6-fS_sN4AaABAg,ag,"Your idea of free speech is to compel an artist to remain an associate of a business that they no longer wish to do business with? Maybe you should understand free speech before you lecture others on it. Understand statecraft, because Spotify is not the State.

Do you not even understand the basic concept of ""the marketplace of ideas""? You put forth your ideas, you say your piece. But that is not where it ends. Then the mechanism by which this MARKETPLACE works... is that then people have THEIR say in response, in order to filter the good ideas from the bad, leading to social progress. In a marketplace, not every product has equal success. The marketplace does not mean all words are equal. It means that concepts that ring true will be perpetuated, while bad concepts will sink to the fringes where they belong. If you don't want fringe ideas like racism to become mainstream, then you engage with the marketplace in that manner, by refusing to do business with companies that push fringe, harmful concepts (and underpay you to boot.)",2022-02-05T19:56:10Z,2

I happened to be born a white woman, (& spent most of my life hating on myself & how I look), but understand, agree & love this anthem & it's truth. Black women don't need to have weaves or straight hair, or East Asian women have surgery to make them look 'European' & change the shape of their eyes, white women don't need to have a Kardashian ass surgically implanted, fake boobs or trout pouts! Across the globe we women all seem to be unhappy with ourselves üòî. None of that 'additional external' is necessary to show our beauty in this manner because true beauty is what you already possess. It took me many years, too many, to realise that what India Arie was saying was the truth. All women, irrespective of from where in the world they come from, are 'enough' as they are & should be content to be the beautiful that they are. It's too bad as women we can't learn these lessons when young when our confidence could do with this knowledge. (Recently my next door neighbours six year old daughter told me that she no longer wanted to eat her vegetables & salads because she didn't want to become fat!!! WTAF?? That made my heart hurt. Her family are from Russia, they have a typical Russian stereotype look, she's tall for her age, is a beautiful kid & looks set to be a beautiful woman when grown. Six years old & already she's learnt to hate her lot?!! Saddens me no end!). IA is just a Queen & these lessons should be taught to girls from all walks of life from a young age to prevent future generations of women from hating on themselves. üëë ‚ù§Ô∏èüåº",2020-09-12T13:21:45Z,5

Outside of America we have the wonderful invention of the internet as well and we are able to view videos and say whatever the hell we want to say . I live in a predominantly black country where it is perfectly acceptable to tell a woman just how BEAUTIFUL her black skin is. India is a beautiful black queen that helps other girls know ¬†how to appreciate our MELANIN and that it makes us beautiful. If you see anything else, maybe you need to re-evaluate your life and your opinions. Also, wth does living among white ¬†people have to do with enjoying being black? I do not live around white people and I accept myself for who I am, I do no need white people to enjoy being black. If I was to continue I would end up writing a damn book.

You know, it's truly mind boggling that anytime a black woman explicitly makes space for other black women with a msg of encouragement, then suddenly it's a universal message. When the civil rights movement/ black power movements occured back in the day, other groups saw it as a call to action for themselves as well, like the Jews, to be proud of themselves too.. WITHOUT taking away the SPECIFIC msg from black people to other black people. Even though all people benefit when a group feels pride within themselves, there should never be an erasing of the particular group's esteem building targeted within that group. It's a form of dismissal I'm seeing from these other comments, wanting to appropriate the msg as ONLY universal, not meant to uplift black women in particular.

I heard once that a girls boyfriend wouldn't even hold his new born child these are just some of the hang up that you grow up with as a boy and especially to grow up in the hight of the feminist movement there's a lot of pressure and there's most typically no where to go with how to deal with these issues of masculinity; so we put up barriers like ""as a guy I really this song about Loving yourself in your own body"" because men do have self image issues and it's seen as non masculine to have such or even to like a female musicians for whatever reason it seems everyone is much more comfortable when we only like them because of the way they look which to me is a step backwards but that is the place society puts men, and their is no place for us to go to talk about and express and work out these issues.

I think that there are people who choose to listen to the music and pay attention to the products/celebrities that are marketed are going to feel that this is all there is. Yes, the idea is to turn us into people who only focus on base desires.. but if you separate yourself from that you will connect to others who share a similar vision. There are plenty of people in this world who are really uplifting others and having an impact that will not be televised or advertised. But you won't idolizing Beyonce and finding it, i tell you that.",2015-03-20T04:26:49Z,0

568,UghqUucdFUHHsHgCoAEC,John Evans,"@JoziGal¬†wow, I have to take my comment back. This is some of her best work. I listened to a bunch of music by her today and she is nothing more than pure pop. She is just like every other R&B pop star. Beautiful body, beautiful face, beautiful voice, but can't write a song to save her life. Here is a list of actual artists so you can compare and contrast. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† -Mariem Hassan
-Yasmin Levy
-Ali Farka toure
-Doomtree
-Elephant Revival
-Andrew Bird
-Son Little

Now listen to these groups, get some music education on good song writing and music writing, and then tell me how great India.Arie is.¬†

And if you are looking for real poetry in your music listen to some ¬†Josh Ritter, Justin Vernon, or Dessa. These are true song writers. India Arie doesn't even exist on the same planet as these people. I dare you to listen to them and then say otherwise.¬†",2014-11-13T01:39:41Z,0
569,UghqUucdFUHHsHgCoAEC,Ari C,"@JoziGal¬†that's exactly what I was thinking. ¬†
This is a song from the late 90s John, that's why it seems very pop. ¬†
This was a fabulous song in that era and it has meaningful lyrics now. ¬†There is nothing about it which is done to death, I can not think of another song that is about loving who you are without making any disparaging comments about others. ¬†And that is the point, that is why this is so powerful. ¬†I am sure the sound quality could be improved if it was re-recorded, but why should it, to please those who are stupidly fussy.",2014-11-12T23:58:31Z,0

571,UghqUucdFUHHsHgCoAEC,John Evans,"@ZigZaggy P¬† It's trite because it has been done a million times before. Doesn't mean it is bad, but it isn't new. Plus the music itself is repetitive and boring, and very pop. Compared to the music that I usually like this is very shallow and designed to sell records, and not an honest representation of this artist. Also, saying that something is a ""sad commentary on our times"" is also very trite and a rather meaningless comment.¬†",2014-08-04T21:37:59Z,0
