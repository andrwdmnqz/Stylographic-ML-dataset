Hey hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
And I said I need dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me

Bad times are comin' and I reap what I don't sow
Hey hey
Well let me tell you somethin' all that glitters ain't gold
Hey hey
It's been a long old trouble long old troublesome road
And I'm looking for somebody come and help me carry this load

I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Well I don't know if I'm walking on solid ground
Cause everything around me is falling down
And all I want - is for someone - to help me

I had a job but the boss man let me go
He said
I'm sorry but I won't be needing your help no more
I said
Please mister boss man I need this job more than you know
But he gave me my last paycheck and he sent me on out the door

Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Said I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
And I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me
Well I don't know if I'm walking on solid ground
Cause everything around me is crumbling down
And all I want is for someone to help me

What in the world am I gonna to do tomorrow
Is there someone whose dollar that I can borrow
Who can help me take away my sorrow
Maybe its inside the bottle
Maybe its inside the bottle
I had some good old buddy his names is whiskey and wine
Hey hey
And for my good old buddy I spent my last dime
Hey hey
My wine is good to me it helps me pass the time
And my good old buddy whiskey keeps me warmer than the sunshine
Hey Hey
Your mom of mayhem just a child has got his own
Hey Hey
If god has plans for me I hope it ain't, written in stone
Hey Hey
Because I've been working working myself down to the bone
And I swear on grandpas grave I'll be paid when I come home
Hey Hey

Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Said need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need hey hey
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me
Come on share your dollar with me
Go ahead share your dollar with me
Come on share your dollar give me your dollar
Share your dollar with me
Come on share your dollar with me",David Cekov,0,2019-02-18T14:28:18Z

Hey hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
And I said I need dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me
Bad times are comin' and I reap what I don't sow
Hey hey
Well let me tell you somethin' all that glitters ain't gold
Hey hey
It's been a long old trouble long old troublesome road
And I'm looking for somebody come and help me carry this load
I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Well I don't know if I'm walking on solid ground
Cause everything around me is falling down
And all I want - is for someone - to help me
I had a job but the boss man let me go
He said
I'm sorry but I won't be needing your help no more
I said
Please mister boss man I need this job more than you know
But he gave me my last paycheck and he sent me on out the door
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Said I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
And I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me
Well I don't know if I'm walking on solid ground
Cause everything around me is crumbling down
And all I want is for someone to help me
What in the world am I gonna to do tomorrow
Is there someone whose dollar that I can borrow
Who can help me take away my sorrow
Maybe its inside the bottle
Maybe its inside the bottle
I had some good old buddy his names is whiskey and wine
Hey hey
And for my good old buddy I spent my last dime
Hey hey
My wine is good to me it helps me pass the time
And my good old buddy whiskey keeps me warmer than the sunshine
Hey Hey
Your mom of mayhem just a child has got his own
Hey Hey
If god has plans for me I hope it ain't, written in stone
Hey Hey
Because I've been working working myself down to the bone
And I swear on grandpas grave I'll be paid when I come home
Hey Hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Said need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need hey hey
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me
Come on share your dollar with me
Go ahead share your dollar with me
Come on share your dollar give me your dollar
Share your dollar with me",Einvo,31,2018-03-14T03:43:36Z

It's been a long old trouble long old troublesome road
And I'm looking for somebody come and help me carry this load

Well I don't know if I'm walking on solid ground
Cause everything around me is falling down
And all I want - is for someone - to help me

I had a job but the boss man let me go
He said
I'm sorry but I won't be needing your help no more
I said
Please mister boss man I need this job more than you know
But he gave me my last paycheck and he sent me on out the door

And all I want is for someone to help me

What in the world am I gonna to do tomorrow
Is there someone whose dollar that I can borrow
Who can help me take away my sorrow
Maybe its inside the bottle
Maybe its inside the bottle
I had some good old buddy his names is whiskey and wine
Hey hey
And for my good old buddy I spent my last dime
Hey hey
My wine is good to me it helps me pass the time
And my good old buddy whiskey keeps me warmer than the sunshine
Hey Hey
Your mom of mayhem just a child has got his own
Hey Hey
If god has plans for me I hope it ain't, written in stone
Hey Hey
Because I've been working working myself down to the bone
And I swear on grandpas grave I'll be paid when I come home

Please mister boss man I need this job more than you know
But he gave me my last paycheck and he sent me on out the door
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Said I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
And I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me
Well I don't know if I'm walking on solid ground
Cause everything around me is crumbling down
And all I want is for someone to help me
What in the world am I gonna to do tomorrow
Is there someone whose dollar that I can borrow
Who can help me take away my sorrow
Maybe its inside the bottle
Maybe its inside the bottle
I had some good old buddy his names is whiskey and wine
Hey hey
And for my good old buddy I spent my last dime
Hey hey
My wine is good to me it helps me pass the time
And my good old buddy whiskey keeps me warmer than the sunshine
Hey Hey
Your mom of mayhem just a child has got his own
Hey Hey
If god has plans for me I hope it ain't, written in stone
Hey Hey
Because I've been working working myself down to the bone
And I swear on grandpas grave I'll be paid when I come home
Hey Hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Said need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need hey hey
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me
Come on share your dollar with me
Go ahead share your dollar with me
Come on share your dollar give me your dollar
Share your dollar with me
Come on share your dollar with me

2357,Ugz8A__sriqEI6MYV254AaABAg,"I'm aware of the lyrics dude.  In the song he asked if the answer to his problems were in the bottle.  That is not an endorsement of becoming an alcoholic loser.  It is merely an acknowledgement of the realities that a lot of people have to deal with.  Obviously the correct way to deal with tough times is to keep working, doing your best, and doing whatever you have to do. Asking for a dollar is a reflection of a guy going through tough times, not advocating panhandling. I don't think you get it",Matt Wilemon Wilemon,0,2013-10-11T02:01:02Z
2358,Ugx-DV3WrC96uEZoCKl4AaABAg,"I don't like your condescending attitude. Have you listened to the lyrics?

2359,UgygkBGN3dat9CBbbb94AaABAg,"I think you are reading too much into it and are adding things to the song that nobody is actually.  It is simply a song about a guy who has had a rough life, lost his job, and doesn't quite know what to do.  I think in this world of low wages and high unemployment that a lot of people can relate to what he is saying.  Nobody is talking about being a panhandling, drunk, or a victim, or any of that stuff except for you.  I think the meaning of this song has clearly gone over your head.",Matt Wilemon Wilemon,0,2013-10-11T01:23:55Z
2360,UgzC7wiu04jir4wyxIt4AaABAg,"I can't believe people listen to this song and aren't outraged. A song about begging for handouts, becoming a wino, and turning yourself into a victim instead of trying to get a job and make your own way in the world. This song has done more damage to a positive black image than very rapper on the west coast combined. At least someone singing about illegal work is still singing about work, not acting victimized and becoming a washed out, pan handling, wino. ",Kodack Gaming,0,2013-10-11T01:03:19Z

If the Irish vote Yes, there'll be permanent austerity placed on us by Germany and the other powerful EU countries who enjoy throwing their weight around.",Flowing Freely,0,2012-04-29T00:34:48Z

I'd rather live in a country that is being used as a joke lately due to the problems that is facing because of the global economic crisis,despite its great history and civilization that inspired the West and sparkled Reinaissance, than in a country with no social welfare (free education and healthcare).Thats what the vid is about",Marinemauro,0,2012-04-28T22:54:28Z

It is not good for society overall, simply because opportunity costs (what is unseen) is ignored. 100 million died because of the misallocation & purges from them.",mana2432,0,2011-04-14T07:14:14Z

and what does money buy? the most basic survival requirements

common sense is that one should not have to worry about whether one will be able to afford the basic survival requirements - or anything else that enables us to live a dignified life
