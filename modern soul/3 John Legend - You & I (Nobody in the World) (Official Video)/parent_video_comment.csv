anyone can say ""he cares"" but its how you make someone feel what youre telling them says it all",Raf Reyes,0,2022-05-04T03:20:13Z

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later to pay for the sins of mankind to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.
2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

In the music video we see a collection of beautiful people who think theyre not, they do everything they can to modify themselves to fit a false sense of beauty, because beauty is not defined. They pierce their ears (4:32) put on makeup, workout, do their hair, wear jewelry, think there body types are wrong, and in general, are dissatisfied w themselves, they get home or to their locker and want to break down because they dont want to do it, they dont want to change, it brings them literal pain and it fucking sucks and its so sad. Everyone is beautiful, but they believe they are not because its defined, and dont give themselves permission to be them, and to be happy, and know that they are beautiful just the way they are, towards the end of the video you see this become a reality, they accept themselves and others accept them, and their faces light up and they believe they are beautiful as they should and its so beautiful to see. And it made me cry. Because i always felt it in my soul, that if people would just believe the truth they are beautiful how happy they would be and how much easier their life would be, all the characters seemed to spend all their waking hours trying to be something theyre not (sounds familiar to my story) to get home and look themselves in the mirror and be depressed bc even if someone did love them, it wasnt really them (also my story) and its so FUCKING heartbreaking and it needs to stop.",Alexander Sucala,0,2021-09-26T23:56:20Z

Se o espelho não vai torná-lo mais claro eu vou
Ser quem lhe vai dizer
De todas as meninas
Você é a minha única menina
Não há ninguém no mundo esta noite
Todas as estrelas, você fa-las brilhar como se fossem nossas
Não há ninguém no mundo, só você e eu
Você e eu
Não há ninguém no mundo, só você e eu
Você para o salão quando entramos
Holofotes ligam, todos estão olhando
Diga a esses meninos, eles estão perdendo tempo
Parem de ficar na fila, porque você é toda minha
E esta noite eu, não vou deixar o sentimento morrer
Eu nunca quero sair do seu lado
De todas as meninas
Você é a minha única menina
Não há ninguém no mundo esta noite
Todas as estrelas, você as faz brilhar como se fossem nossas
Não há ninguém no mundo, só você e eu
Você e eu
Não há ninguém no mundo, só você e eu
Você fica na dúvida se é você que eu quero
Você não precisa nem tentar
Você não tem que tentar
Não tente
Não tente
Você não tem que tentar

Você é a minha única menina

225,UgzreZ7a45bdFHjJZGp4AaABAg,"Everytime I listen to this song, I start thinking of everyone I've lost. Specifically, I think of my mom. I lost her when I was 4, so I didn't really get the chance to, but sometimes when my brain allows me to have certain flashbacks if my mental state is good**, it occurs to me I don't think she ever really understood or was verbally told enough that she was beautiful. I say verbally cause all the stories I here NOW make her out to be a saint (in a good way), always thinking of and literally putting everyone before herself. And I understand since I do the same thing unconsciously. But I started to realize that's pretty sad because maybe she did it so she COULD feel beautiful, so when'd she ever do something selfish for her? I'm speculating, and she's gone so I'll never really know unless she wrote it somewhere, but I know that I push myself to my absolute limit physically and mentally for others, and I'm honestly not a good person (which I've accepted now in a sad twisted way I suppose), so I can only imagine how she, who was a good person, felt.

Maybe you're like her, and I just want you to know you are loved and you are beautiful whether you realize that or not. I believe her willingness to extend herself so far and so thin was part of the reason she died so young, and I don't want that for anyone else. You ARE beautiful just the way you are. ❤️

They’ve ALWAYS BEEN WRONG. Don’t you dare change yourself for some one who’s opinion is based off what is seen on the surface. 

   Take it from me. I can’t even say the number of times I’ve been bullied or called ugly, there too many. Honey, you are beautiful.

 💖🖤在整個人類歷史上，強者，富人和具有狡猾特質的人捕食部落，氏族，城鎮，城市和鄉村中的弱者，無`'守和貧窮成員。然而，人類的生存意願迫使那些被拒絕，被剝奪或摧毀的基本需求的人們找到了一種生活方式，並繼續將其DNA融入不斷發展的人類社會。.
 說到食物，不要以為那些被拒絕的人只吃垃圾。相反，他們學會了在被忽視的肉類和蔬菜中尋找營養。他們學會了清潔，切塊，調味和慢燉慢燉的野菜和肉類，在食品市場上被忽略的部分家用蔬菜和肉類，並且學會了使用芳香的木煙（如山核桃，山核桃和豆科灌木 來調味g食物煮的時候$!",Emily Warren,20,2021-03-19T21:37:31Z

You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause your all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I",siobhan pennington,203,2020-12-11T18:42:11Z

Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are

575,UgzQ8S_bfXEfFKNuB514AaABAg,"COVIDNINETEEN VACINATIONS, THE 1ST STEP TOWARDS THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE SOON. A great and formidable enemy seeks to enter into the very blood of My children through the altering of your DNA. Because of the curse that came about after the fall of the first man Adam, I came to make a way for you. You are renewed and made clean again by your belief and salvation in Me, your King and Messiah, sent by My Father to redeem you by My blood sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary. Only through Me, the Door, corruptible is made incorruptible, unredeemable made redeemable. I have ransomed you in order to bring creation back to its Creator. Creator YHWH was made flesh to overcome death, hell, and the grave, and to take what was tainted and impure and make it whole again.
The spiritual battle that is raging now is ultimately to strip you of the Divine image of Myself that has been placed within the DNA of My creation. Ask Me for more wisdom and revelation about this and it will be given to you. The veil was torn, access granted when I shed My blood, died and rose again. We have created you in Our image, and when you walk in holiness, righteousness and purity, obeying My commandments, I am enthroned on your heart. You are then transformed in body, soul and spirit. When this transformation occurs, the very frequency of your cells then resonates with Me and raises you closer to your Creator and further away from the lower realm and lower frequencies which keep you bound. This is by design, and when indwelled, My Holy Spirit will be the gatekeeper of your heart, and your entire being, My sanctuary, and the place where I reside in you. When this occurs, My Kingdom is on earth, as it is in Heaven. It is then that I am able to provide victory over the curse for you, preserving the Divine design I have placed within your DNA. There are many layers of revelation to know what is coded there and hidden, secrets to be revealed to only those who overcome.
However, if the gates are breached by sin, lack of obedience, compromise, or lukewarmness, the enemy sets up thrones (strongholds) instead of Me, because my laws, My Word have not been written on your hearts. You have a sworn enemy whose utter mission is to destroy you. He will stop at nothing, and as My Word has foretold, the time is here when the greatest of all violence and evil against My people, those made in My image, is taking place. The battle is for the soul, and the battle is about the blood. Satan’s ultimate goal from the beginning was to corrupt the seed, corrupt the blood that carries My blueprint in you, My design for those made in Our image, your DNA.
There is only one way to ensure that My Throne is upon your heart and your eternal destination is sealed, or your soul will be lost forever. Your must be born again. Your heart must be sealed with My blood. You must be quick to repent often and seek holiness above all else. Love what is true and just. Be extremely careful what your eyes see and your ears hear. This is guarding your heart, guarding its gate. It is in sealing these portals to the soul, in commanding the spirit to govern or have mastery over the soul, that you overcome. You will then be prepared for My return, and be protected from the evil one.
If you have not already done so, seal the portals to the enemy now! Confess your sins and repent for the midnight hour is here! Bind the access points that have given satan legal rights within your temples, within your body, mind, soul and spirit. Give satan and all his dark kingdom a certificate of divorce and be free from the bondage, and from all the oppression and possession in your bloodline immediately! Break the curse from your ancestors back to Adam. Cover it all with My blood and command the enemy out of your bloodline, sealing it as well, the gates to your heart, using the authority you have been given through Me. Exercise dominion as a gatekeeper and a son or daughter of the Most High God, taking your positions as heirs to My Kingdom. My Holy Spirit will then have permission to use you for My glory and manifest through you in this crucial hour.
*(Please see the prayers on the right hand side bar and the one titled Increased Demonic Warfare Prayer covers everything He is instructing here)*
This must be done this moment!! This is crucial! Precious moments remain before the implementation of the enemy’s plan to destroy the DNA of My creation, making you forever unredeemable. The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and it must be taken by force! Take My Holy Word and dispossess what has had control of your gateways and that of your family line through covenants, oaths, soul trades and agreements made by your ancestors. Do it this moment! In Me you will be made FREE!
The implementation of the plans to alter your DNA and make it programmable by something other than Me, your Creator, are here. I control and govern the DNA I have placed within you, but if you allow man to administer anything within your bodies, that will recode your DNA, I will no longer be the controller. I will no longer recognize you as My creation. You will have become a mixture of something else, an altered form of man and technology, and therefore, not in My image any longer. Do you understand what I am saying? Truly the hour is here when you must prepare to make the choice to remain fully human, infused with My Spirit. The enemy wants nothing more than to deceive you through propaganda, fear and manipulation and cause you to allow either a mark or an implant (vaccine or digital tatoo) into your bodies that will forever separate you from Me. This is your reality right now! You must know what you will choose to do.
When you open doors to the enemy through sin and through your choices in life outside of My ways, the demonic spirits appoint gatekeepers over your heart, your mind, and your soul. Then those spirits invite more, and when no repentance occurs, strongholds occur. The heart of an unregenerate man is wicked and deceitful above all things. But My Word is quick, powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing apart of your soul and spirit, your joints and marrow, as I discern the thoughts and intentions of your heart. Allow Me to write My laws on your heart and you will know truth at last. You will know what is now directly in front of you and the choices that are here for you and your loved ones. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, but it does NOT have to be this way. Allow My glory to penetrate your spirit so that your soul will come under submission. To not allow this, means you will remain in bondage and you will be easily deceived. If I do not dwell in you fully, and your gates have been breached, another will easily influence you and take governance.
My people, I have given you the keys to the Kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven and whatever is loosed on earth will be loosed in Heaven. Bind the strongman, bind the strongholds on your life and be delivered!
The technology for the mark of the beast is here. It is upon you. It will be presented at first to be taken voluntarily, then very soon after, you will not be able to buy, sell or work. Do not wait another moment. Come out of Babylon and make Me King of your heart, the Divine Gatekeeper of your soul.
The evil ones have set in motion their wicked schemes, as it must be so according to My Word. Many, many judgments will occur as I allow them. This is to wake up My church. You must know where you stand in your walk with Me, because in an instant, everything will change, and there will not be another opportunity to choose, because the choice will be made for you. You are either all in, or I am turning you over to your carnal mind and nature. You have the choice My loves, choose life and eternity in Me over eternal death in darkness.The time is now.

Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago
If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you
You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine
And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world
You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight

John Legend is a musical genius as we all know! LOL! And he definitely is killing #lifetimePartnerGoals daily on top of being a clearly devoted and loving father to his beautiful daughter and precious son! But the man is obviously a sensitive, compassionate man with an open, loving heart who can see beauty and hear music all around him!! He couldn’t write such accepting, loving, empowering lyrics sooo beautifully that can move people sooo profoundly without having the soul of an artist, the intelligence of a psychotherapist who can see and understand people at their core, and the view of a world from the view of it’s Creator for he sees beauty in places people hide in darkness and strength in moments of weakness!

never get underestimated by bullies or bad jokes.
you may think no one will never love you, you will never get a girl or boyfriend. 
but there are more people that you think love you and care for you
i used to think no one loved me. I always knew my parents never loved me, but I found out that there were still my friends out there. I used to be called fat when I was not and after a while, my friends told me I was too skinny and I should not worry about what other people told me. I went to the doctor and they told me I was underweight. i already knew i was underweight but i listed to what other people told me

1488,Ugwaf7WAHxaBi7oeFn94AaABAg,"You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago
If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you
You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine
And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world
You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I",ila,345,2019-01-11T16:54:31Z

1567,Ugx88-HEd3mAlieO17N4AaABAg,"What a great song. For me this video is about being 'the one'. I don't mean about being the object of desire or the center of someone's attention. These are selfish indulgences at best. I mean this is about being the one who tells the person that you love that you are the person in their life whose attention they have fully and forever. This is about letting them know that in their journey to find someone who loves them, you are a source of that love. I've been married over 20 years now. That message feels new when ever i give it to my beloved, and I know she never gets tired of hearing it, because for her it feels new every time as well. It is the equal/opposite of the need to love one's self. It's about the equally important need of our loved ones to feel loved. It's our obligation to make our loved one's know that. That's what I got out of this song.",Mike Shramko,0,2018-11-26T18:41:15Z

She kept saying she was ugly the first week I met her because of bullying at work and I played this.
She hugged me and said sorry for being weak, I said don't say sorry for that. Crying because of hurtful words is not weakness.
Saying things to hurt someone is weakness.
I said you're beautiful and don't need this makeup shit- then the music synched up and she looked me in the eyes.
I sang ""ohhhhhh, you don't have- to try, dont try, don't tryyyyy, you don't have to try"".

Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago
If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you
You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine
And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world
You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

1847,UgxwK8VkmYfD0p_7hyB4AaABAg,"Sorry but all of you that think that nobody gives a shit about the inside are wrong, I don't know about you, but I see many people here complaining why other people don't care about the inside, the way I see it, there are many people that do care about personalities, but the problem being, instead of looking around them and seeing the other people thinking the same, they keep complaining and running behind people that dont care.

Sure, there will always be superficial people that just care about the outside, but they are just PART of society, not all of us. The problem is, that we, insecure people or people that have been insecure focus too much on the superficial people instead of focusing on people that appreciate personality over physics. I've seen here people talking about taste and yeah they right every person has different taste, but we shouldn't focus on our physical taste but rather on our personal taste. Instead of focusing on finding a person that loves the same movies as you, try to find a person that appreciates the same personality as you do. 

But before starting to look for external love, try to find internal love, start appreciating all parts of you, start loving you and be comfortable around you and when you're finally able to be happy with yourself, then go and find someone that feels happy by your side.",Mauricio Eder,0,2018-06-25T14:02:36Z

Today after 20 years of marriage and 23 years together (we were in our early 20's when we met) we are separating and possibly divorcing. Now this song reminds me that I'm still crazy in love with her.,TheSlows,0,2017-12-21T10:24:57Z

Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world, but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world, but you and I

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause your all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world, but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world, but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world, but you and I",Javier Mendoza,0,2017-10-14T01:44:20Z

Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlight's on everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I",Syuzanna Ghochikyan,0,2017-07-19T19:02:33Z

Guess you don't know
That your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago
And if your mirror 
Won't make it any clearer 
I'll be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world 
But you and I, you and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on, everybody staring
Tell all of these boys 
They're wasting their time
Stop standing in line because your all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never want to leave your side

Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world 
But you and I, you and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
You don't have to try
Don't try, don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
They don't shine rather than you are
Ain't nobody in the world 
But you and I, you and I, you and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world 
But you and I

2832,UgjiXmAXwbrHQHgCoAEC,"I always get emotional no matter how many times I watch this.
I was always bullied and called gay for respecting women growing up.
My mother was beaten in front of me multiple times as a baby.
She is the most loving mom ever so I hate any abuse towards women.
I have PTSD from it and can never see a boy hurt a woman now, I snap and attack who evers the agressor towards the girl.
This song is what I was always exhuberating in life so it's nice to hear that someone feels the same way.
I'm not mad at the dudes that treated me like shit, I feel bad that they didn't feel enough love to the point that they would'nt know how to treat a woman or a girl.
That they'd then judge me for excelling in a way they couldn't.
They are just sad.

2886,UghnbdnEubym3XgCoAEC,"I've loved this song the first time I heard it. unfortunately, this was my first time seeing the video. John legend made a beautiful song for his wife but this video made me shed tears of joy and sorrow. I've had a horrible childhood from child abuse to foster care to 4 years in prison. Now live alone,own my second vehicle,and work everyday. The one guy who I thought was there for me turned out to be a liar, cheater ,and verbally tells me how fat I am. I've always been skinny and loved it but from being in prison so long, I've gained 40 pounds.😢 It's hard to deal with that. There are times I force myself to throw up because I don't want to gain any more weight. Long story short, this beautiful video makes me grateful for what I have and makes me feel beautiful even with all the weight gain.

Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause your all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and i",Blank,16,2017-04-07T23:30:17Z

3017,UgjRB10W7kSWrHgCoAEC,"Omg. This song makes me cry everytime I listen to it. It's so crazy because I've actually had boyfriends in the past who wouldn't wanna see me without makeup on or without weave in my hair. Who would call me fat or bloated if I gained a few pounds. This is a serious issue in our society. And it's unfortunate. Women are even denied certain jobs based on how they look. This song just reinforces to me that I'm beautiful just being me without any extra things. Women, we are ALL beautiful. And the next time someone has something negative to say about you, in the words of Mary J. Blige, just say ""Take me as I am, or have nothing at all.""",Emberly Zellars,1,2017-02-23T19:58:44Z

3172,Ugh6Y2HFilGNfHgCoAEC,"To all of the hateful people attacking the 'perverse agenda' of homosexuals... You seem to be implying that homosexuality is wrong because lying with someone of the same sex is considered an abomination, though it is never stated exactly why it is so, only that it is such. Heterosexuals have sex all the time, sexualizing women AND men and turning them into explicit exchanges of pleasure and money with no level of companionship or emotional intimacy to speak of. Homosexual relationships are more often than not COMPANIONSHIP AT ITS BEST. Heterosexual relationships, as far as Biblical theory is concerned, are/were geared toward reproduction. The Bible does not uphold the bodies of women, which are so precious, the way it upholds the male agenda. Everyone deserves happiness. Stop attacking what isn't yours to command. If you truly believe in the Lord then you'll let him address the things you feel are sinful, instead of taking it upon yourself to attack others. Homophobia to a discriminatory degree is on the same level as racism, there is no controversy there. You are attacking people for WHO they are instead of the things they've done. They have done nothing to you except offend your eyes, apparently; Really anyone is capable of doing that nowadays. All the shit going on these days and happy gay couples are your trigger? Get right and get a life.",Shenzi Okoye,0,2017-01-02T23:53:12Z

I really have deep respect for the woman who dared to take her bra of and show her scars of surgery. My mom passed away because of breast cancer 6 years ago. My granny had breast cancer too long ago and had a breast amputated (she lived 35 years after that before she passed away of old age and a broken heart a day after my mom passed away). Granny did always made jokes about it. She used to recall being in hospital, her neighbour came to visit and granny just pulled her shirt down. The neighbour said: ""Eeehk don't do that!"" and my granny said: ""What's wrong? There is NOTHING to be seen!"" one time we got an ice cream and the waitress said: ""How many balls of ice do you want?"" and my granny said: ""Make it one so I have two again.""",Ivanka R,0,2016-12-08T10:10:35Z

3503,UgjFIG2u8igZX3gCoAEC,"I liked the concept of the video and appreciated the attempt at diversity. However, the vast majority of the women in this video were portrayed as cis gendered or had traditional female aesthetics. I have mixed feelings about the fact that Youtube didn't have us log in and confirm our age to view this video because of the woman who is a breast cancer survivor. I don't really think the human body should be censored at all, but Youtube often does according to their policies, but in this case they didn't.  I've never seen another woman's full breasts shown in that way without having to log in, does this mean Youtube no longer considers hers to be breasts? Do nipples make breasts? Really? John has a wonderful way of honoring women with his music about them and the experience of love in general. Let us raise the next generation of young men to be so classy and to treat women with such respect!",cornellcutie1,20,2016-11-12T03:45:58Z

3750,UghGB5ASqd9EHngCoAEC,"I give so much respect to the lady in the middle of the video who took off her bra to display that she got nothing to fear. From what I know, dealing with perilous illness such as breast cancer is not an easy battle. So many women today are still struggling from the aftermath, sometimes they fall into depression. What she did was not merely an act of bravery but also something that corresponds to the main point of this music. That everybody deserves to love and to be loved. Regardless of the condition or situation in which you are in currently.  She is portraying that her personal scars from battling with a horrendous disease is not going to stop her from showing her true self and her right to be embraced.  Man... this is one of the greatest songs I've heard recently. Thanks John Legend for creating something as valuable as this.",jakester2179,5,2016-09-07T16:07:30Z

Real sincere.

I love his music but his overall message in this video is conflicting with his... life. I agree with this message but I do not *believe* it coming from him. This is directed at his wife and not average women. Maybe is not his fault but the director's fault. Pandering to women but lacking in substance.

Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlight's on everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are

But people still forget that many of these artists went years struggling just to make it... until their work paid off and awesome people gave them a chance. But they kept grinding no matter what! John is like this for sure!! That's the mentality that I share in my music. If you are one of those cool people to give a nobody a chance, stop on by my channel. I promise I have been putting in work and I might surprise you. Either way, always show love to the music and have a good one! Peace.",Caleb Hart,581,2016-06-17T01:02:29Z

Guess you don't know
That your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago
And if your mirror 
Won't make it any clearer 
I'll be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world 
But you and I, you and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on, everybody staring
Tell all of these boys 
They're wasting their time
Stop standing in line because your all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never want to leave your side

Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world 
But you and I, you and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
You don't have to try
Don't try, don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
They don't shine rather than you are

Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world

""You & I (Nobody In The World)""

You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlight's on everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I",Gabbar Singh,0,2016-05-09T05:54:59Z

                            You fix your make up, just so

Guess you don’t know, that your beautiful

Try on every dress that you own

You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago
If your mirror won’t make it any clearer I’ll

Be the one to let you know
Out of all the girls

You my one and only girl

Ain’t nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours

Ain’t nobody in the world but you and I

You and I

Ain’t nobody in the world but you and I
You stop the room when we walk in

Spotlights on everybody staring

Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time

Stop standing in line, cause your all mine
And this evening I, won’t let the feeling die

I never wanna leave your side
Out of all the girls

You my one and only girl

Ain’t nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours

Ain’t nobody in the world but you and I

You and I

Ain’t nobody in the world
You keep wondering if you’re what I’m wanting

You don’t even have to try
You don’t have to try

Don’t try

Don’t try

You don’t have to try
Out of all the girls

You my one and only girl

Ain’t nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, they don’t shine brighter than you are

Ain’t nobody in the world but you and I

You and I

You and I

Nobody in the world tonight

Ain’t nobody in the world but you and I                     
                        
                      Traduzione
                            Sistemi il tuo trucco, allora

Immagino che tu non sappia, che sei bellissima

Ti provi ogni vestito che possiedi

Ai miei occhi eri bellissima mezz’ora fa
Se il tuo specchio non ti chiarirà le idee

Io sarò colui che te lo farà sapere
Diversa da tutte le ragazze

Tu sei la mia unica ragazza

Non c’è nessuno nel mondo stanotte
Tutte le stelle, le fai brillare come se fossero le nostre

Nel mondo ci siamo solo io e te

Io e te

Nel mondo ci siamo solo io e te
Tu fermi la stanza dove stiamo entrando

Hai i riflettori puntati, tutti ti fissano

Di’ a tutti questi ragazzi che stanno perdendo il loro tempo

Smettetela di stare in prima fila, perché tu sei tutta fila
E questa sera, non lascerò morire il sentimento

Non voglio mai lasciarti
Diversa da tutte le ragazze

Tu sei la mia unica ragazza

Non c’è nessuno nel mondo stanotte
Tutte le stelle, le fai brillare come se fossero le nostre

Nel mondo ci siamo solo io e te

Io e te

Nel mondo ci siamo solo io e te
Continui a chiederti se sei ciò che voglio

Non devi neanche provarci
Non devi provarci

Non ci provare

Non ci provare

Non devi provarci
Diversa da tutte le ragazze

Tu sei la mia unica ragazza

Non c’è nessuno nel mondo stanotte
Tutte le stelle, sei più luminosa di tutte loro

Nel mondo ci siamo solo io e te

Io e te

Nel mondo ci siamo solo io e te

You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlight's on everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I",Maii Walaa,2,2016-03-06T10:26:12Z

Use their negativity to Empower You and with each negative event that may cross your path use each one to Build Yourself a step to wherever You are going. They think they are hurting you but in actuality they are helping you achieve and get closer to your goals!!!! My heart goes out to Everyone who has gone through this, knows somebody who has gone through this and for the unfortunate who may at one point go through this.

Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

So many of us are struggling on the streets, too many of us are making the kinds of choices no one should ever have to make, and too many times the struggle to be visible ends in violence . . . but for a few moments tonight, I listened to your song and watched your video . . . a few times actually. I had never seen it before just now. It's 2:20 a.m. . . . All around this country, Trans activists are giving up their weekends and whatever free time they have to develop strategies that will convince our local, state and national elected leaders, our families, our local police, our bosses, classmates, co-workers and anyone else who will listen to look our way and understand that we need them to see us, accept us, and respect us. Your song reminded me that even though many of us live alone and in fear, we have allies who risk an awful lot to make sure we know we are loved  . . . and for that, I am grateful. We cannot climb the mountain that is before us without someone taking our hand and pulling us upward. ~ Char",Charin Davenport,54,2015-12-19T07:32:01Z

I'm the luckiest man on this entire planet and don't ever want it any other way  .

Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

I'm going to marry that man & spend the rest of my life with him. He has his moments where he's self conscious & I just wish he could see himself through my eyes so he'd know how beautiful he is. He's the most beautiful person on earth to me, inside & out. It doesn't even matter what he looks like. I'm in love with him for who he is and I will find him attractive if he gains weight or becomes disabled or... Anything. Love is blind. Looks are secondary. You cannot truly love someone just for how they look. That is lust. You love someone for the person they are. You fall in love with their mind. All my life I thought I knew what love was until I met him & it's more than I've ever imagined it being.

You & I (Nobody in the World)

John Legend

 You fix your make up, just so Guess you don't know, that your beautiful Try on every dress that you own You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll Be the one to let you know Out of all the girls You my one and only girl Ain't nobody in the world tonight All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours Ain't nobody in the world but you and I You and I Ain't nobody in the world but you and I You stop the room when we walk in Spotlights on everybody staring Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time Stop standing in line, cause your all mine And this evening I, won't let the feeling die I never wanna leave your side Out of all the girls You my one and only girl Ain't nobody in the world tonight All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours Ain't nobody in the world but you and I You and I Ain't nobody in the world You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting You don't even have to try You don't have to try Don't try Don't try You don't have to try Out of all the girls You my one and only girl Ain't nobody in the world tonight All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are Ain't nobody in the world but you and I You and I You and I Nobody in the world tonight Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

Guess you don't know that you're beautiful 
Try on every dress that you own 
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago. 

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer i'll 
Be the one to let you know 

Out of all the girls 
You're my one and only girl 
Ain't nobody in the world tonight 

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours 
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I 
You and I 
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I 
 
You stop the room when we walk in 
Spotlights on everybody staring 
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time 
Stop standing in line, cause your all mine 

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die 
I never wanna leave your side 

Out of all the girls 
You're my one and only girl 
Ain't nobody in the world tonight 

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours 
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I 
You and I 
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I 

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting 
You don't even have to try 

You don't have to try 
Don't try 
Don't try 
You don't have to try",L M usic,3,2015-05-23T16:22:26Z

'You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago
If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you
You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause you're all mine
And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side
Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight'

Regardless of her scars, I'd love that woman to the ends of the earth and show her every second I possibly could. She deserves it.

Even the transsexual woman is beautiful. So all the ignorant males out there should watch this video and learn something from it, because i'm pretty sure some of you males arent perfect either and have no right to judge someone just because of their body type or wieght or height or looks or anything.

You fix your make up, just so

妳停下來補妝，一如往常

Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful

我猜妳並不曉得，原本的妳就無與倫比的美麗

Try on every dress that you own

妳不停地試穿衣櫃所有的衣服

You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

但其實早在半小時前，妳的模樣就已楚楚動人

 

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer

假如鏡中的倒影，還無法讓妳明白

I'll be the one to let you know

我願是那個親口告訴妳的人

 

Out of all of the girls

在所有的女孩裡頭

You're my one and only girl

妳是我心中獨一無二的存在

Ain't nobody in the world tonight

今夜再也不會有別人佔據我的心房

 

All of the stars,

在群星籠罩下

you make them shine like they were ours

是妳點亮星光，讓它們全繞著我們轉

Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

除了妳我之外，整個世界彷彿全然不存在

You and I

只有妳和我…

Ain't nobody in the world but you

而妳成了我眼底唯一風景

 

You stop the room when we walk in

當妳踏入房間，時空瞬間停了格

Spotlight's on

鎂光燈閃耀著

everybody's staring

所有人的目光都駐足在妳身上

Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time

告訴那些躍躍欲試的男孩們，別浪費時間了

Stop standing in line,

離開隊伍吧

'cause you're all mine

因為妳已是我的

 

And this evening I won't let the feeling die

在午夜來臨前，我不會輕易讓這悸動消逝

I never wanna leave your side

此刻的我只想流連在有妳的氛圍裡

 

Out of all of the girls

在所有的女孩裡頭

You're my one and only girl

妳是我此生唯一的摯愛

Ain't nobody in the world tonight

今夜再也不會有別人佔據我的心房

 

All of the stars,

在群星籠罩下

you make them shine like they were ours

是妳點亮星光，彷彿它們就簇擁在身畔

Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

在我們之外，整個宇宙全都屏息以待

You and I

就妳和我…

Ain't nobody in the world

再也沒有旁人存在

 

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting

妳不斷猜想，自己究竟是不是我要的那個女孩

You don't even have to try

但妳根本不必這麼大費周章

 

You don't have to try

妳從來都不必這麼努力

Don't try don't try

從來都不必…

You don't have to try

不必費盡心思成為別人眼裡的模樣

 

Out of all of the girls

在所有的女孩裡頭

You're my one and only girl

妳是我此生唯一的摯愛

Ain't nobody in the world tonight

今夜再也不會有別人佔據我的心房

 

All of the stars,

在群星籠罩下

they don't shine brighter than you are

妳的燦爛遮蔽了所有光芒

Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

除了我們之外，整個世界彷彿全然不存在

You and I. You and I

只有妳和我…

Nobody in the world tonight

今夜再也沒有旁人

Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

在我們之外，整個宇宙全都屏息以待

Women make women feel bad.....try to look better...get envy from other women. For what though? to drop another persons confidence?

Maybe I'm ""preaching to the choir"", but equally to all the fellas and ladies; just by watching this it goes to show you that no matter our natural inhibitions, mental handicaps, or physical disfigurations there will be a few people, or maybe ending up being that one particular person that will unconditionally and thoroughly care for you genuinely and infinitely. Even though we try so hard to adapt to this reckless, inconsiderate, bloodthirsty, and self-destructive world; we have to start with ourselves to initiate U-N-I-T-Y and stop acting like tough guys inflicting harm and maledictions on each other.",MJBThePeacekeeper,1,2015-01-31T18:17:05Z

Especially, JLO, I am more than amazed on how dedicated she is in making her body look so good, but wiggling her @s$ on screen at her age just makes me want to sh!t on her face while w@nking!!!

Você corrigir o seu make up, só assim 
Acho que você não sabe, que o seu belo 
Tente em cada vestido que você possui 
Você estava bem nos meus olhos, uma meia hora atrás 

Se o espelho não irá torná-lo mais claro que eu vou 
Ser o único a deixar você saber 

Fora de todas as meninas 
Você minha primeira e única menina 
Não há ninguém no mundo hoje 

Todas as estrelas, você fazê-los brilhar como se fosse nosso 
Não há ninguém no mundo, mas você e eu 
Você e eu 
Não há ninguém no mundo, mas você e eu 

Você parar o quarto quando andamos em 
Focos sobre todos estão olhando 
Diga a todos esses meninos, eles desperdiçando seu tempo 
Pare de pé na fila, fazer com que seu todo meu 

E esta noite, eu, não vai deixar o sentimento die 
Eu nunca quero sair do seu lado 

Fora de todas as meninas 
Você minha primeira e única menina 
Não há ninguém no mundo hoje 

Todas as estrelas que você fazê-los brilhar como se fosse nosso 
Não há ninguém no mundo, mas você e eu 
Você e eu 
Não há ninguém no mundo 

Você continua querendo saber se você é o que eu estou querendo 
Você nem tem que tentar 

Você não tem que tentar 
Não tente 
Não tente 
Você não tem que tentar 

Fora de todas as meninas 
Você minha primeira e única menina 
Não há ninguém no mundo hoje 

Todas as estrelas, eles não brilham mais do que você é 
Não há ninguém no mundo, mas você e eu 
Você e eu 
Você e eu 
Ninguém no mundo hoje 
Não há ninguém no mundo, mas você e eu",Junior Sete,0,2015-01-25T00:42:18Z

We don't need make up or extra things to make us beautiful. I always bring myself down but when watching this it bring my spirits up and shows me I am not the only one with imperfections. No matter who we are, we will never be perfect in anyone else's eyes except our creators. Gay, lesbian, trans, bi, straight, fat, skinny, curvy, short, tall no matter what  we are. We are all women of god and we shouldn't worry about the bad, we should embrace the good in all of us. This is why I love john legend, his songs aren't about drugs or using women, he wants to better the way women are looked at and showing men that its not about the booty or boobs, and that girls shouldn't choose men that look for that. They should look for men or women to love them for who they are and what they bring to the relationship not their body",uneeklybeautiful_6199,2,2015-01-05T21:21:28Z

You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlight's on everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

I've found the man that showed me true love, kindness, hope, friendship... happiness... he keeps holding the flashlight even when I want to drop it and run back...
Thank you, my wonderful husbando, you've showed me the way and you keep standing by my side even it it's hard... You showed me the meaning of Love and Happiness... I have loved you since I've met you, until now, and forever I will, because in this world, it's only you and I.

This song is for every women who feel insecure about them selfs and this video says you're beautiful no matter what. And that's exactly what guys need to know. They want every girl to be like a model, but what they don't show is that they're insecure to. So why not accept everyone for who they are and how they look.

You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlight's on everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

His reply was "" I picked this song because i know you dont see yourself at beautiful or sexy. You wont believe me when i tell you that you are beautiful and amazinly sexy. I want this to be our song so when your dont feel beautiful you can listen to these lyrics and realize....ill always love you no matter what you look like. No Matter what happens.

Not have political arguments in the comments of a youtube video because as a society apparently we are all too ignorant and self righteous to allow anybody else to have an opinion if it does not fit in line with their own.

I have a great idea youtube, end comments, give comments the death penalty, you will finally give John Oliver something to be happy about in Last Week Tonight instead of make me hate the world a little more with every video.",Nelson Field,0,2014-10-30T02:01:41Z

6771,UgiKm8voJEqe1XgCoAEC,"Im a realist. A realist speaks the truth. The only way to progress is to be honest with the truth. Humans are lazy and selfish. There are many women who are overweight in America. This is mostly due to poor exercise habits and poor eating habits but genes and thyroid problems, etc. also contribute to obesity. Women don't worry about being fat until they get a funny look or somebody says something mean. This causes insecurity. Many women go back to food for short term comfort. In most cases I would bet that the leading factor in young women deciding to make a change in their health is because of insecurity embedded into them by experiences in a society that promotes ""thin is beautiful"". I believe that if there were no criticism of obese women then we would have many more obese women. My point is that it is sad that the only reasons that young women want to change is more because they want to be accepted into society and less because it is good for your health. So the reason girls decide to change their lifestyle is for a shallow selfish reason. I personally find it incredible how weak-minded we can be having soooooooooooooo many capabilities in this world. Just because others around you hold themselves to a certain standard does not mean that you should do the same, we are wayyyy more capable than what we believe ourselves to be.

People are gonna judge you rather your fat skinny beautiful or ugly. 
The key is not to let them knock your self esteem I will agree that being oversize isn't the healthiest way to live life but it doesn't make you less of a beautiful person. Who am I to judge anyone because I was once in that spot.I worked my ass off to get where I am now and to ppl I'm probably still not considered attractive (Weight wise) but I simple don't give a fuck 😒👌I have nothing to prove to anyone on this earth but me. Not everyone sits around and eat and is lazy some people develop thyroid and other health problems that can cause your weight to increase.its sad as hell that people hurt and judge others on what they lack as if your flawless every human being has flaws idgaf if you the hottest female or male if you have a bad attitude thinking you better than someone so you knock another persons self esteem you ugly af in my eyes beauty is soul deep and its absolutely nothing wrong with a plus size woman or man having confidence

Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of the boys they wasting their time 
Stop standing in  line cause you're all mine 
And this evening I won't let the feeling die 
I never wanna leave your side

There is nothing nasty about it he is just trying to show girls to  be in love with themselves and how they look. Most of those girls had conditions that they were born with and they have to live with it so he is making this video to show girls they are perfect just the way they are. It's amazing how most people are saying the rude stuff they say but probably are the same ones who run and put make-up on just to take a selfie. Us young ladies and Women have to understand that you can't depend on what a man says about you or what others say. We are very emotional creatures we go through a lot but if we don't learn to love and live what god has created us with than we will always be miserable and depend on what everyone does. Yes, this is a love song and he is basically talking about his wife but he also giving a message to women don't go out the way so much just to look good for someone. We have Flaws And All.

I don't understand how people can live their lives looking for the negative sides of every little single thing they see or hear. I you don't agree with the idea of the song, there's no reason to be rude about it. If you think fat/chubby girls are not attractive, then it's your call and it's okay (same goes for those who won't find a skinny girl attractive).

Stop trying to change everyone into your own limited way of thinking and just live your damn life. Stop looking or hearing things you don't like even if others do enjoy it. Comment all you want about how wrong I am or how stupid my ideas may seem. Honestly, all I care is if some can actually relate to this comment. If it's not the case, then it's fine.

A really long time ago, girls were treated as slaves and useless people while guys were treated as actual human beings. Obviously, that doesn't happen anymore but this still kinda happens. No offense but I think girls suffer more than guys because we are always forced to look attractive all the time. Oh and we also experience period and childbirth which is the worst thing about being a girl. This might sound pretty useless but being called ugly just because you're not wearing makeup hurts a lot. And girls are usually raped, abused, and sexually harassed. Those things happens rarely to a guy but it happens all the time if you are a girl. Btw, why are you guys (not all) so mad about girls? We don't say mean stuff to guys so don't do the same to us.

Me: Boo fucking hoo.
Let's begin with the fact that many music videos are FOR men. They hyper-sexualize women and focus around tmen being dominant no matter what; whether it is in wealth, work, or relationship. Let the women have this one. It is such a positive message for everyone, and it can benefit you men as well, just look at it from different perspectives. Try to see how uplifting this could be for some women who don't find themselves worthy or attractive. Men say they want confidence in a woman, that it is ""sexy.""

7156,UgjQgjkKN4qViHgCoAEC,"To Danny Villasana,, Jesse Williams, ""John McClane"" and other commenters on this video (I'm going to assume you're open enough to discussion to read all of this):
Before any of you say that we don't need videos like this, that the message is wrong, that X or Y people can't be attractive or that we owe you being attractive, I sincerely beg you to consider this.
While there ARE standards of attractiveness for men, women are the ones expected to take diets (sometimes even from ages as early as 12 or under), to put on make-up, to dress provocatively (but not TOO provocatively, because it's then HER fault when men aren't capable of basic control, apparently). We are taught to suffer and bleed for beauty. Yet, as you can see in representations of the typical average family in media such as The Simpsons, you are allowed to be fat, to not take care that much of your physical appearance, and still have a wife who loves you no matter what.
We don't have such freedom, since people can openly and constantly criticize us if we don't fit your very specific and unrealistic criteria. Both men AND women, because women are taught that a GREAT portion of our worth comes from our physical attractiveness; no matter what we're doing or where we are there will always be a comment about our appearance, even if we're working in NASA or running for the Olympics. Even little girls learn to become self-conscious about their appearance, and that's NOT healthy. And that's not even beginning to mention stuff like race or gender identity.
Beauty, however, is in the eye of the beholder, and beauty standards were VERY different in other time periods; they are NOT universal. Did you know fat women used to be preferred to skinny women, since it meant more wealth and ability to bear children?
Did you know you can be fat AND healthy? Did you know you can be naturally big or skinny, and that trying to change that can destroy your health? Did you know there are women of all different body types and face structures, with different styles, tastes and orientations, just like with you?.
We need videos like this because of men like you. We don't owe you anything.
(keep in mind that I'm not trying to undermine self-conscious men; I understand men can still be judged by their appearance)",Danae O.,1,2014-09-19T18:17:08Z
7157,UggCophwuWIReHgCoAEC,"I wish if they also included in this video a Muslim woman wearing a headscarf. I say this because as a Muslim Arab woman who wears the headscarf, people often  looks at me or treat me different, some are very judgmental even if they don't say it or show, I can feel it. I lived in the West/US for sometime and I still chose wore my scarf(hijab), if I got a coin for every time people ask me why i'm wearing it although I live alone, or I should take it off because ""no one"" can see me, I would be rich by now. Problem is that some are judgemntal because they think that women who wears a scarf are ""oppressed"", whereas what i think is even in other societies if you got to wear certain clothes to impress others due to society pressure, you're also oppressed. In the end, scarf or no scarf, clothes is not what makes us who we are, it's us who we want to be, and how we want others to perceive us. ",Rim,1,2014-09-19T17:11:40Z

The message behind this is so beautiful, and so rare to find nowadays, especially from an artist as popular as John Legend. Beauty comes in all forms, and all different shapes and sizes... Society would not have us see it that way. Every single woman in this video was stunningly beautiful... not only in appearance, but in smile and in confidence. To have the bravery to do a video like this when society's expectations are what they are is amazing, and I greatly admire every single one of them. There are always the ignorant, who insist that anything outside of societal norm is unappealing... but they are just that... ignorant. Confidence and comfort in one's own skin is an amazing feat to achieve, and I truly believe that beautiful messages like this video being shown in popular media is just what society needs. A truly amazing song, an even more amazing video, and truly beautiful and extraordinary women. Thank you for this <3",Sarah Lomenick,1,2014-09-19T05:41:19Z

Some of them are genetically that way and cannot help the way they look and asshole guys who seem to think their opinion on women matter need to take those rude words and shove it up their crusty pretentious asshole. I am so sick of men thinking they can instruct girls what's attractive an what isn't. Girls can dress for themselves, believe it or not the majority of the time girls don't dress for a man to find them attractive. They dress to feel confident in themselves. And if a fat girl wants to dress up and feel good why can't she? The girl in this video is fucking gorgeous. Body weight does NOT determine weather somebody is attractive or not.

7331,Ugg9pRS_5aOAUHgCoAEC,"I do not fully understand the hate songs about inner beauty get. This song is not about being heavy or skinny or ugly or fat. It is to encourage woman and even men that society can not say what is beautiful and what isn't that burn victims and special needs etc  are beautiful in their own way, not to hide and conform to what society says. That our flaws are what makes you, you and you are beautiful. ",Mikayla Nunez,0,2014-09-09T20:17:58Z
7332,Ugj0OhM5vyg4kngCoAEC,"I just read this comment and all of its replies: ""Why would a transgender person be in a video about women? EVERYONE thinks you should support the LGBT community and I do but this video is for women not men who want to be women. ""  and more or less youtube responded in Laverne Cox's defence, and while I'm glad they did,  they failed to really address or answer this ""Cam"" individuals comments appropriately, ignorantly focusing more on what makes or defines or classifies an individuals gender. Unnecessary. First of all - Did you write this song? Did you conceptualize this video? Were you apart of the production team? Is your name John Legend? No? Then I'm severely confused... Because if you had nothing to do with conception and or creation of this project, then who are you to definitively dictate ""Who"" this video is for and more specifically ""Who"" this video is not for? John Legend and Co. wrote this song, conceptualized the video and purposefully chose to incorporate each and every single soul you see represented in this video.  Not you or anyone other youtuber with an ""opinion"", and thus this video is for everyone represented in it. Make sense. Awesome. FYI in the future when stating an opinion or question, simply do just that, state your opinion or question i.e. ""this video is for women not men who want to be women"" is not an opinion but rather a definitive statement that falsely, arrogantly and ignorantly attempts to dictate the artistic and love expression that foundations the true intention behind this video, an intent you did not conceptualize or manifest in this first place. I digress. @johnlegendVEVO Thank you for this beautiful expression of Love. It truly blesses and ignites my soul every time I watch it! Be blessed, and have a phenomenal day.

We are all different, if God wanted everyone to be a size 1 we would all possess that look. He is not encouraging obesity, he is simply saying that no matter your race, color or size you are beautiful. Not everyone was built to be a size 2 and I personally think if someone is comfortable in their own skin, who gives us the right to tell them otherwise. ""Average"" size people die everyday it doesn't mean that if you have some meat on your bones you are automatically unhealthy. We make obese people because we constantly bring them down about the way they look but who are we to judge them. You let them know that they are beautiful no matter what anyone has to say or feel and if they see it fit to change let them make that decision instead of shoving it down their throats.",Millicent Thomas,1,2014-09-06T14:53:46Z

7384,UgjjyENit0Eui3gCoAEC,It's kind of mean to call them fat. Using the term overweight is much more nicer than being blunt about it. Even though they are big in size that does not mean that they are not beautiful. Women overweight can have a naturally beautiful face. They just have problems with their eating habits. There's no need to be hateful. I believe every person on this earth is beautiful. Doesn't mater what you look like. There is no such thing as ugly. We're all different so how could you define it?

You wonder why women have a hard time believing their beautiful? When there are so many people there to break down their self-esteem. Maybe your opinions of transgender, overweight, disabled, scarred, or ""ugly"" women is irrelevant. They have had their struggles, and instead of giving them 'tough love', why not encourage them to embrace who they are. John Legend always holds women on a pedestal because he values their worth, regardless of their physical appearance.

7417,UghMc8Gj9qMNB3gCoAEC,This video isn't about the exact people in the video. It's a representation of how every single girl in this world has anxieties and worries about their appearance. Anyone with negative comments about the girls in this video are the reason this video was probably made. We're all self conscious because of the sort of comments that have been said about this video. If someone can learn to be happy with themselves why do you need to say your opinion about them. I don't think any of you realise the damage you could be causing.

don't make fun of the fat kids,
you might have one,true?

'You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago

And if your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlight's on everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine

And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I'

But I'm also incredibly disappointed and sad that a bunch of people write extremely rude comments about others bodies and the way they look when most of those people feel like they need to change their own bodies because they aren't even able to accept who they are so to all those people I would like to say: I don't care if you don't like your body, that's your problem. And if you don't like someone else's YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO JUDGE. It's terrible how you can turn this beautiful message that someone clearly made so people wouldn't feel as self-conscious and would feel better about themselves into a hate club and tear that all down??

Julia proclaims that she has always loved me and so we had sex and I told her that I love her too. I don't know if I really love. Karabo on the other hand is very special. I broke up with her when I met Julia because, she did not give me much of her time. Her family did not allow her. Now, me and her made contact and she still wants to be with me. If I were to choose I would choose Karabo because, she really rocks my world. She makes my world to stand still. The only problem is that I don't want to hurt Julia and if I break up with Julia, Karabo's family is too strict, they still won't allow her to see me and I won't be able to spend time with her.

7563,Uginnvu1it5YpngCoAEC,"I understand the honest comments on this video. However, I do know men and women that are attracted to bigger women. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. There are too many insecure women in this world and I think this video sends a beautiful message. Though, I do think that a woman needs to feel beautiful to herself first! Sometimes they do need a some help to realize their beauty. I repeat, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I do not agree with the way some people treat their body or how they are not eating or exercising. The emphasis on THEIR body though. Not mine, I choose to love my body and wish the best for people. With the homophobic comments of Laverne Cox, get over it. She has chosen to be in the spotlight, she is a transgender. Read up on the transgender community and the mental & physical aspects of it. Kudos to her. I understand we all have an opinion. Just make it sound respectable and not disgusting.

Though it's also important to remember that plenty of self-confident, happy, and self-worth acknowledging women put makeup on, wear earrings, etc. It's also important to remember that plenty of women aren't super insecure about their image or self-worth, despite there being many who are. Also, this message isn't telling people that obesity is healthy. It's telling people that no matter what, they don't deserve to be shamed for their appearance and that they are still beautiful. That's a subtle but big difference. ",ilinaeternity,0,2014-08-20T14:10:55Z

I was hoping to scroll down and see people feeling as wonderful as I did after watching, but apparently the world is just too judgemental, uneducated, uncaring and prejudiced to even begin to understand. Wake up and realise it's not all about you and what you're comfortable with, that people's bodies are their own and you cannot pass judgement or police them because of your own feelings of uncomfort. Wake up and realise that the world doesn't exist in binaries but in a spectrum of never-ending proportions. Wake up and realise that people have the right to feel beautiful and right in their own skin, however much they had to change to get there and however much they didn't. And they are beautiful.

7736,UggG58x9oxafs3gCoAEC,"I lost my shit at 2:44- I can't believe with the power of the message portrayed here is, how sensitive every woman (No matter what age, race, gender identity, sexual preference, weight, or economic class) is about her looks, that the men below me can only comment on fat people being unattractive or whether or not some woman is really a man. The painful truth that you all don't want to face is that it's people like YOU (Jesse Williams!) that are the reason every woman looks in the mirror and question themselves. You know what, plenty of people could argue that they find a woman without a breast unattractive too, but who would be so heartless to point that out. Everyone's body is different. You MISSED the message here. If you're that shallow then there's no way I can see for you ever understand empathy, compassion, or love. ",Ashley Somethin,0,2014-08-19T18:22:13Z

I've seen too many of these videos with girls feeling insecure/sorry for themselves (this one, Colbie Caillat's Try, Miley Cyrus' 7 Things), when somebody should really make one with guys doing the things that guys do to be beautiful.
Most of my friends are boys, and I see firsthand how they try really hard to be gorgeous for girls and for everybody else. They worry as much as girls do about their appearance.
Also, women shouldn't need to be told they're beautiful all the time. One of my best friends told me that she thinks the most wonderful thing that a girl can be called is ""smart,"" not ""beautiful.""",100percentjoy,0,2014-08-19T10:58:43Z

If an obese, gorgeous& beautiful, woman makes a song about body image it's romanticizing obesity and mental illness. Guys call girls out on their weight all the damn time and call us rude ass names like a land whale. Girls, as far as i'm concerned, don't say shit about men's weight and call them rude ass names. All I'm getting is that girls should be sticks but, have an ass and tits, shut the fuck up, and make men sandwiches and guys can be whatever they want, have no rock solid standards, be complete cock pops, and jizz on their shorts all day while eating said sandwiches.

Some things can't be helped in life, a girl in my wife's special needs class that has downs syndrome and she loves being called beautiful and wearing make up. They were made special and need to feel loved too. There has been so many suicides by overweight or have other problems  because they feel unloved. Have some sympathy. Good grief.

CA. there was a young girl maybe 15 or 16 that played with matches when she was 3 yrs. Her body was 87% burned from head to toes. She was going thru skin grafs and her boyfriend came from Kansas to ask her to the Senior Ball! She is such a beautiful young lady inside and out. She asked me why would he want to take me? She said that she is so ugly, I explained my Older Sister married her Husband even after he contracted rabies and was disfigured and both leggs amputated and she was still deeply in love with him, 37 years later. And was at his bedside when he passed away just this year R.i.p.  Long story short.  Beauty is within your heart and the way a person carries themselves. Ugly people are those ignorant people who call others ugly. ",Gabriella Johnson,0,2014-08-06T23:27:09Z

8070,Ugh5EXVUu5r5oXgCoAEC,"I'm tired of people saying ""all these women are beautiful."" In God's eye they are his creation, but you guys aren't God. You guys don't have perfect eyes to say ""I think that all these women are beautiful!"" It's sad that you guys have to lie to yourselves. Don't say things just to make yourselves receive attention. I'm Christian, but does that mean I think all women are beautiful? No, I judge people just like you guys do.",Brandon Chu,1,2014-08-06T16:20:55Z

Yes she was born that way but she changed it because she was not comfortable. I don't fully understand the transgender process so I won't speak on it but I know many of you who are slandering her know even less than me so please be intelligent & if you have not-so-flattering comments, keep them to yourself.

It's not a question of who you find attractive, it's the statement that all humans are beautiful. It's not up to you to decry who is beautiful and who isn't. Someone will love us for who we are, and it's okay if it's not you. Just don't put people down just because you don't find them to be your 'type'.",Molly Cole,1,2014-08-05T19:56:22Z

Do you guys really think that this whole bullshit 'free the nipple' campaign is about sexism and gender politics? Uh, yeah, no. More like self-aggrandisation and exhibitionism.

The female breast will always be freighted with more sexual associations than the male breast. Who's fault is this? Women explicitly attempt to make their breasts more predominate so as to appear more sexually attractive to men. Breasts are not just a sign of femininity, but a sign of sexual maturity. How do you expect men and growing boys to have respect for women? Have you now realised how ridiculous you sound? This nonsense masquerading as a meaningful political cause is just an excuse for certain women to be exhibitionists.",mori mori,1,2014-07-21T21:35:53Z

So WHAT if you saw a woman who had to surgically remove her breast due to a TUMOR being in it! You think SHE wants to look at it?! She keeps thinking she's ugly and disgusting and no longer a worthy human being so who are YOU who doesn't know her struggle to say SHE'S RIGHT?!

Sure, there are insecure girls who believe they are not pretty enough for him/her, but some girls (and guys!) try to improve their looks to improve their mentality. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that, yes, this message holds true for some, but others just use makeup, clothes, jewellery to make themselves feel good and confident and powerful :) Men also have to keep remembering that women try not for the men, but for themselves.",Isabella Pham,3,2014-07-20T00:21:16Z

9316,Ughuxyk1RyXTDngCoAEC,"Funny, this song is all about women wanting society (particularly men) to realize the beauty of a woman should not be determined by superficial or materialistic factors, yet many, many women choose only to be in a relationship with a man due to his financial status and/or things that he owns. How often do you see a 10/10 woman with an overweight or unattractive man? That's right, almost NEVER. Unless of course he is the owner of a multimillion dollar business or famous. Where are all the songs telling women to not only look at men for what they have. That's right, THERE ISN'T ANY. No musician would ever produce a song telling women to look on the inside of a man as opposed to what he has financially because of the uproar it would cause in today's society and how it promotes the degradation of women. This is yet ANOTHER piece of media proclaiming the greatly exaggerated (at times non existent) mistreatment of women in today's society.",Frenchman,1,2014-07-16T17:03:14Z

Don't you understand John Legend's theme that driving this song, whether you like the song or not?  THe message is more important than the damn song pro or con. And it's not only applicable to women be they transgendered, white, a woman who has undergone a mastectomy; the message is very clear (at least to those who understand the issues of self-esteem and body image, female and male, to reinforce the beauty of the inner being. Having survived a severe eating disorder of 29 years, and after several hundred thousands of dollars spent to save my life, this is a song of reinforcement for me personally. And it's my responsibility as a male, 14 years in recovery from that damn eating disorder, to publicly speak out and to dispel these ridiculous comments. WHen a human being is ""shamed"" for not being what the Kardashian clan and the fashion media are dictating, living with all of that unnecessary shame is absolutely life threatening.

I think this video is amazing, and it has such a great beat. Skinny, not skinny, make up, no make up, short or tall, sickness or none we are all equal and beautiful.

Men and Woman need to stop shaming each other out on our imperfections, because for a fact, everyone is beautiful, and everyone is unique.

At first it might even be the sole element a person can grasp when they look at someone but later on that victoria's secret model might open her mouth and completely destroy the attractiveness she conveyed through her image while the obese woman, while not seeming beautiful at first might open hers and make a man think twice about his first impression of her. In terms of sex, maybe the victorias secret one would always be chosen when taking into account her exterior beauty. However, in a relationship just sex wouldn't cut it. She would have to be much more than a barbie to make something the cut for a prosperous relationship. And thats where less attractive women may come in and offer more substance than fitter ones. Not to say that ""attractive"" women can't have both interior and exterior beauty (the beauty society/media imposes) but when it comes down to one or the other a  man looking for a life long partner will always choose interior beauty.",Natália Loureiro,0,2014-07-15T02:04:32Z

We can only feel good from within if first we learn to accept what we look like from the outside. Everyone is different and go through a million changes over the course of life. However, the way the world interacts we never seems to understand nor think of all these other issues such as bullying, racial and cultural norms (several other experiences) and they way social media seems to interact when something looks appealing compared to another that people perceive and suggest to be ""ugly"" or ""unpleasing"" to the eye. This may be a lot to take in and I can be wrong as well, to which i leave the world to decide. However, this perception has been ideal to help me perceive others as equally beautiful and that beauty is something that is woven in everyone, if you chose to view others in such a way. ",Harpal Mehmi,0,2014-07-14T18:43:25Z

It's because from the beginning of time women in most cultures have been told to be beautiful, decorative and viewed for pleasure. Society pressures men and women to be beautiful, but it's a lot harsher on women. These songs are about empowering women because honestly, these issues exist and are enstilled into young, young girls and we need to address them.

If you are him and you can see this post I hope and pray that you get the help that you clearly need sir.  Your comment was totally rude and un called for.  You think it's bad for people to be fat and that what did you say something like ""fat people are unattractive"" well I have to disagree with you on that one.  My best friend was a plus sized woman. She was beautiful not only on the inside but on the outside as well.  She was such a great person, she loved everyone and everyone loved her.  She was the nicest most genuine person I've ever met and I was so blessed to have her in my life for 35 years.  She was such a nice and sweet person but however there were people out there LIKE YOU who could only see the outside appearance and not even try to see the inside.  She may have been strong and loving but she was a human being WHO HAD FEELINGS and sometimes things got to her. She made up in her mind that she was going to start working out and even though she lost a noticeable amount of weight there were still JERKS like you out there picking on her and making rude comments just to hurt her so she finally couldn't stand it and went to have surgery. She died on the table!  Something went wrong and she died.  My best friend died because she was tired of ASSHOLES like you making fun of her and she thought she'd be more accepted if she looked the way society thinks beautiful women should look.  I'll never see her again, her 3 year old daughter will never see her again, he mother and father will never see her again. We'll never see her smile again or hear her laugh so hard that she snorts all because of STUPID jerks like you who think that just because a woman isn't a size 0 she's unattractive.  Well I have news for you sir, everybody on this earth is beautiful and just because YOU may have an opinion about something doesn't mean that you need to voice it.  Haven't you heard the saying :If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all?""  You should really practice that.  There are many beautiful PLUS SIZED people out in this world and they all have feelings! You don't know how a person thinks they may be one step away from doing something that could put them in danger or get them killed. You could say something rude to someone and that one rude comment could make them kill themselves....  Do you really want that on your conscience? Remember that the next time you want to voice an opinion. JERK!  Rest In Peace Andrea Marie Smith. You were my best friend and I will love you forever.

9810,UghDu-9gKZdmEngCoAEC,"Hello, your friendly neighborhood youtube commenter here on this specific video ""You & I""!
(◡‿◡✿)

Please avoid dwelling on the negative, transphobic, misogynistic, racist, ignorant, fatphobic or ableist comments you might find down here in the youtube comment section of the video, because some people are profoundly sad, lonely and/or deathly afraid of things they don't understand!

Or if you want to understand, take take to educate yourself, and the internet is a bountiful place for growing your knowledge and awareness! Don't be afraid. 
 
Just wanting to wish everyone on this video a good day and allow yourselves to feel loved and special in someone's eyes. And if not for another, than for yourself!

It is important to note:
The song may be very commercialized and profits off of ""you don't know you're beautiful until I tell you"" sort of thing. That is a thing to be acutely aware of, especially if you are female-identified!
And some women and femmes don't necessarily prepare themselves aesthetically for anyone, but do it to feel good and enjoy the art of self care!

But it is also very intimate and loving and recounts John Legend's feelings towards his wife, Crissy Teigan in a very pure and and sincere way at this time! That is very special!

Also it is a good chance to inspect ourselves for what we find internally beautiful and precious in others and ourselves, even though human flesh is temporary, and even human memory and vivacious human life is even more temporary. 

You are loved very much,
#FriendlyNeighborhoodYoutubeCommenter. (◡‿◡✿)",Pantonesara,2,2014-07-14T07:07:20Z

Some may not like that John Legend is not with a black woman, but it is his life not ours, so enjoy your same race or interracial relationship (or lack thereof). Some may not like the lesbian aspect of the video, but it's their life so enjoy your heterosexual life. Some may not like the transgender woman aspect but it's her (or his, whichever you prefer to believe, she identifies as a woman so I will address her as such) life, enjoy your chosen or God-given reproductive organ. Let us all just agree that this is a beautifully written and executed song. Kudos to John Legend! And on a personal side; ""SOPHIA!! :)""

Please do not send hate my way, I'm just a lover of music and all people. Whether you reciprocate the feelings or not will have no effect on my daily life.

10043,UggRpo2hpebJZHgCoAEC,"I love this music video. I think it accurately shows some of the hardships women struggle with everyday. In a society which often glorifies appearance over moral character, women who aren't blessed with the perfect face or hair feel cornered and unworthy in comparison to women who are. It sucks thinking that you aren't good enough because of something that is completely out of your control. and of course there are men who get upset over this sort of thing (patriarchy at it's finest). I'm not trying to say that men don't also experience some of the same struggles women do, but can you at least be fucking empathetic? Women have it hard! there is no denying that. We are finally, but slowly, moving forward in this world as intellectual and completely and equally capable beings. We are just starting to be seen as powerful creatures rather than house keepers and trophies for men to carry around and show off. There are good men in the world, but we all know there are some terribly awful men too, that put women down and demean them in order to maintain control; and if a song and a music video inspires those women and shows them that they are not alone and that they are so much stronger than they actually believe, then who gives a fuck! its a beautiful video that shows that all women have the capability and potential to have a happy life and achieve everything they dream for regardless of the way the look, the struggles they have gone through, and the circumstances they come from. it shows that we shouldn't be shamed for being ourselves and that we are all worthy of the life that we want.",Jessica Pappy,0,2014-07-13T21:10:12Z

Many men can say they don't care, but I've seen how men react to the way women look. I've seen & been through the hell. Not everyone thinks like those who still have their self-esteem. Not everyone is as strong. It's hard as hell to pick your esteem up after being insulted over and over and over again by multiple people. And for some people, music is their rock. Their stability. What keeps them breathing and from taking their lives. So I believe that artists should make songs like this more often.

No, they ONLY cheer when White people are chased down and subjected to a program of geNOcide.

10281,UgjvCLsEUNmIsHgCoAEC,"I think John Legend is amazing and I love this song so much. This song is a celebration to women of all types, shapes, sizes, etc. No matter what you may think of yourself, you're beautiful. Women tear themselves down for their tiniest flaws but this song is speaking to those of us who see your ""flaws"" and just see them as unique personifications of your beauty. As a gay man, I see my girlfriends always doing this to themselves and even those women in my family. This song is perfect because it sings from the heart of love and belief that your flaws are beautiful and without them, you would not be you. Who cares what race is represented more or who specifically shows up in the video, it's the a celebration of women. Btw, John Legend probably asked HER to be part of this video because Trans Females are some of harshest critics on themselves and yet there is nothing wrong with them. This video is for all women to show them that there are men and women who see their beauty through and through. ",Julian Ortega,1,2014-07-13T08:23:04Z

10366,Ugiw96eOMeoGVngCoAEC,"Ok let us just make this clear, this was a beautiful song and music video. John Legend, you sir are a true gentleman and I am happy that you are using your power of music to heal others, empower others, and deal with social issues. However, to everyone here complaining here about ""Omg men don't understand"" or ""Omg how come men don't get the same love"" or ""Omg...etc"" it is going to be impossible to be politically correct. You can't express artistic freedom by always being politically correct. To the women who say, ""men don't get it"", I would say that is a bit of a stretch. There are men out there who are just as broken and feeling as unloved as you are. They are also being told they cant do things by their peers; they aren't just told ""hey you were born a guy go ahead and do whatever you want without harassment"". With respect to the men who are ignorant enough to say, ""hey you females are completely equal and opportunities are exactly the same, stop whining"", open your eyes. The reality is that it is true that females aren't yet equal in society or opportunity, but we will work as a society of both men and women to fix it together. In my personal opinion though I do think that more females are physically and emotionally oppressed. Maybe it is just exposure or the amount that speak out, but I do believe in that. That being said, it just simply isn't true that it is a gender selective problem. Guys aren't immune to that crap, no one is. It is a problem in SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. It is a problem with individuals and not a single man or a woman. It happens both ways so instead of pointing fingers in todays world I think we should just take a moment and realize that we aren't that different from one another. If you have a problem, someone might have the same problem. Lets try and make things better for one another. John Legend is just someone who loves and respects his woman and all other women. I would hope she feels the same way back, but the main focus here should be that one individual is loving another individual no matter what. That person has compassion to try and make things better in the lives of those who might be feeling unwanted or unloved. Anyway, thank you John Legend on behalf of all guys and more importantly all people who feel this way.  I hope we find comfort and love and share it to those in need. Have a good day YouTube.",Alex S,2,2014-07-13T04:53:19Z

Not all ppl are attractive .. who cares? saying you're all beautiful wont cut it.. especially when showing obese and other turn off appearances. For example an obese person will marry someone similar.. they don't have to compare themselves to slim people, why can't they have ""health"" as a motivation to change instead of blaming society for paying so much attention to slimmer girls,, jealous much? then go to the gym.  And that disabled poor girl .. she shouldn't be exposed to what's and what's not attractive. I like all people who have nice personality im just using obesity as an example but not against the,

It was cool right? It's about a woman taking control of her body? right? Total crap! This days it has become easy to become a champion by toting Racism or Crazyism ( crazy version of feminism). Even when women are successful and making great impacts we(Crazyist) would want to say she is under sexism pressure! Talking about Sexism and Feminism, why do we apply it selectively. Nobody cared about Sarah Palin when she made a move for presidency, Now Clinton is here we are playing sexism card! We should simply pursue our goals constructively and not corner ourselves to victim mentality, the way race is peddled in America today. If you are wondering, I am black! Beautiful song.

10556,UggeVCDW82JowngCoAEC,"I look at some of these comments, and there I easily find the answer as to what is wrong with this world. There is little to no humanity left in it. What happened to basic human decency? Oh that's right it's not being taught to children anymore. Just hand them a damn electronic babysitter, or pay for a real one right?  If every parent put as much time into their children as they do themselves these kids would have a fighting chance at a future. One where people care about one another, like they used to. I have a 3 yr old son, and every time someone sneezes whether he knows them or not he says bless you, when the situation arises he says please, he says thank you, he says no thank you, he says excuse me, and all the other polite things well mannered children do. Those little things are basic, and decent. I have my teens do random acts of kindness at least 3 times a yr, as I do myself almost on a daily basis. Because I want them to not only be well mannered, I want them to be good human beings. We are all human, and all know how to be decent to one another. So I ask you, when was the last time you were a decent human being and said something nice to someone you didn't know? Did something for someone other than yourself/family expecting nothing in return? Or took the time to teach your children manners, and what it really means to be a good person? ",Mommy Dearest,0,2014-07-12T23:50:32Z

Despite his meaningful attempt to indicate women are beautiful, it putriates the same stereotypes. Men commenting and setting the tone for what's acceptable and beautiful. Even something as minor as saying "" You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago."" I understand what he is trying to say but a lot of times attire is selected based on mood and make-up a form of expression. The overall irritation are the extremes in the music videos. They are either half-naked grinding on men or as some sad victims that men need to save or make feel better about themselves.",Kamaria,0,2014-07-12T21:32:00Z

I honestly dont know why you men are complaining about how we dont have a song that represents us. What the hell. Weve come along way from giving woman the same equal rights and giving them a chance to be actual people in this world. Men have always been the dominant sex and we should use that to lift women up and make them feel respected. We dont go through have the shit that they do. Giving birth, expected to basically serve yet still look beautiful, work as hard as men do and not get paid the same. Us men, we are told that we can do whatever we desire, as for women.. They have to work twice as hard to even get recognized. In this video i see women concerned about their looks because thats what society intends. That shouldnt be the case. Women have more to them than just their Beauty. This is why everyday i will try to make my mother, sister and girlfriend feel not only beautiful, but also respected and vauable. I suggest the rest of you men do the same. Cheers. ",Samuel Bustamante,21,2014-07-12T20:11:29Z

My *only* concern is that it still ads fuel to the stereotypical fire of female=body/self image link. Please don't misunderstand. I'm not saying women don't have body issues and media pressure from beauty marketing towards ""perfection"", but I think it's time to step away from seeing women as victims that need to be validated externally. I think true acceptance comes from the inside out. Personally for me, no matter how many times someone, anyone, tells me how good I look, it's not going to change the fact that I don't like things about myself, and that's ok.  ",Jay,137,2014-07-12T19:57:40Z

But, as a young male with goals and clear conscience, I've come to ignore the whole ""beauty"" side of women, seeing as its such a typical thing to see nowadays. To me, its not going to make or break what I think about you. Being ""beautiful"" is more say a standard, that only matters based on the eye of the beholder- just like all of you girls expect us men to be in the gym, getting fit, keeping clean, dressing spiffy; its NOT a big deal anymore and is nothing to praise. What PEOPLE should praise and focus on are the women & men who are using their minds, smarts, creativity to innovate and build a better TODAY, setting the course of a better future.

10821,UgjNvD8Pkh8r83gCoAEC,"Why are guys being so selfish???? They like, oooooo John Legend didn't make a vid about my gender, so total dislike. Sure, guys AND girls can be critical about the way they look and have low self esteem. But it's been proven that guys tend to view themselves as more attractive than girls do.

 I watched this Discovery Channel documentary about the science of sex/dating/love, (I WAS CURIOUS DON'T JUDGE PLEASE) and they did this study where random men and women were shown two identical pictures of themselves, but one had digitally enhanced features. When asked which picture better reflected their personality, more men chose the enhanced picture than women.

Of course, this is just a generalization. Everyone's different, and your self esteem depends on a lot of things. But for one thing, only 1% of breast cancer victims are men. The social/physical differences between male and female breasts cause much more self esteem damage for women with breast cancer than with men.

All in all, I loved the song, the video, and the message it came across. Lets just try not to forget that, guy or girl, we can all feel pain, and we're all human. ",Josh Lovett,1,2014-07-12T16:55:29Z

Men talking about how they feel like they're the victims in the grand scheme of things because women get treated so well in our society is enough to bring bile to my mouth. Demeaning these women (because they are ALL women) is part of the privilege that we as a male-dominated society exercise on women in order to subjugate them and steal their agency. Also, Laverne Cox was a women before and after her surgery (btw her surgery is none of our business). Sexual confirmation surgery is only meant to synchronize her body with her identity.

10876,UghxB5qMY_PAgngCoAEC,"This song exemplifies the very essence of what beauty means to us. The saying goes, ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"". This also applies to art, in this case it's the exhibition of women of different shapes, sizes, physical features that epitomize the true meaning of beauty. No one person is ugly, everyone has beauty no matter how shallow, cruel, or fake you are as a person. Many good people out there degrading themselves because they feel the need to please society, why not just be yourself, and stop hiding behind something you're not. Anyways I'm rambling, all in all, being only raised by my mother, I've seldom looked at a woman and said a negative comment about her physicality. We must all be willing to cultivate a better society, and in doing so incorporate, and create RESPECT.

If you want to prance your happy ass down the boulevard spraying pheromones, digging through trash and giving yourself a tongue bath, you can do whatever the hell you want. 

When someone identifies themselves as the opposite sex and they take the necessary steps to become who they know they are - - this is the polar opposite. People want to downplay and throw a royal bitch fit because to them, it's ""not right"" or ""totally unorthodox.""

Well, phuck you and your linear mentality. Just because your ass isn't comfortable with it does not mean it's wrong. ﻿",Substantial_Z,0,2014-07-12T13:07:40Z

When people encounter the real world, with all it's harshness and struggle, the fears and insecurities of youth, school days, and peer pressure, many times, fade away. It's hard to accept yourself at face value, pimples or not. God is not concerned with your outward appearance; He pinpoints what's in your heart.

10958,UghYmrkhLhV7CngCoAEC,"It's interesting to know how many women/girls need validation from men/society to let them know how beautiful they are. I guess I'm lucky in a way because when I look in a mirror,  and I look like crap, I accept it. Also when I look in the mirror and I look beautiful I accept it just the same. 

Now if someone wants to give me their unsolicited advice/feedback on my looks ( my man, sister, girlfriends, coworker) I'd either thank them, or tell them to f off, either way I accept me  and that's more than enough.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to my man when he tells me I'm beautiful. I simply don't need to ask him ""do I look fat in this dress?"" Because the mirror will let me know if I look  bad, and if i do, I change my clothes. I also wish my girlfriends wouldn't ask me those types of questions, because I feel like this: if YOU like it and it's appropriate for where you're going. Just where it.

Shut. The. Fuck. Up.

Just because people are uncomfortable with another person's life choices, that's their business. If it bothers you that much, the only thing you should be telling that person is to keep it to themselves. Stop with all this arguing as though you have the ability to change their minds.

11035,Ugg5Qygb_aE2R3gCoAEC,"Wow I guess secularism has demolished consensus by negating objectivity and elevating preference (no objectivity or parameters of beauty, sexuality, morality etc. and ultimately human identity - a loss of meaning). I think therefore I am (I'm referring to this video calling people beautiful who are clearly suffering from conditions). Fascinating how no one thinks they're a giraffe or something else random like a car. Fascinating how many intellectuals think like this at the dinner table and not in the lab. Why did humanism evict life truth?

And why deny the plight of the deformed or stricken because of a skewed sense of equating beauty with goodness? Their resilience goes unnoticed and uncommended. Resilience to being so beautiful? Is that why the woman with breast cancer teared? Does disease bring beauty? Or does a philosophy of a culture without a point of reference construct a diseased sensuous point of reference that tears a person who feels they cannot be accepted without conforming to the idea that ""beauty is goodness or merit."" Can one be inherently ugly but wondrously good?

This video has great intent to honor some distressed people but it has a disturbing point of reference (or lack thereof with regard to beauty).

11036,UggoAD5Sanow-HgCoAEC,"What can we do to stop this? We can stop putting so much emphasis on physical beauty. Stop telling little girls and boys, ""Oh you're so pretty/handsome!"" Instead, tell them, ""Oh you're so smart and creative!"" When you watch a movie with young people, don't talk to them about how hot the characters are, talk to them about the depth and meaning of the character's actions. When you buy toys for children, don't invest in the toys that focus on manly men or beautiful women, buy them building blocks and things that will test their creativity and engineering skills. When you buy clothes, don't search for clothes that make you look good. You are not the item to be shown off, you are not an extension of the clothes. Buy clothes that look good on you. The clothes are to be shown off, and they are an extension of your personality. (I know that's confusing, think of it as a change of mindset). When you find yourself thinking only about a person's physical beauty, and evaluating them on it, stop and remind yourself that they are human, and they are much more valuable than their body.

I applaud the video for being honest about women, and emphasizing that you're important to someone! But I can't help but feel like this message is redundant, especially living in such a feminist western culture. Men in general treat women like their the most important thing in the world, I'm seriously kind of jealous.

So I'll ask again, where is my song? I mean, there are women out there that still find me important and valuable in their lives even though I'm a painter and make damn near 50% of the national poverty line, right? Right? I'm sure there are, but I haven't met one yet. Nearing 30... *sigh*",John McClane,277,2014-07-12T07:32:57Z

That they don't have to try to look perfect because they are perfect the way they are. Most woman spend all their time in the mirror trying to look like models when they already look like models.

This video (song) also tells you to stand up to people that make fun of girls that aren't as perfect as them. I hate when people are making fun of other people so I standup and next time I standup this song will be on my mind.

P.S. Every woman in this video is beautiful and don't let no body tell you other wise if they start giving you sh*t you fight back with words of wisdom. Don't forget to keep ýour head held high.

11221,UgjD3nbJo_dxMXgCoAEC,"this is an honest question, not intended to be a bigoted one. why is it ok for someone to just will themselves into being the opposite sex? and we're supposed to validate that? if I as a black man, hated my skin, wanted to be a white man and believed myself to be a white man on the inside, and wanted to get surgery to look like a white man, wouldn't we call that a psychological disorder? how is that any different from transgender? please do not get angry with me, be patient with me as I try to understand how this is ok.

i think no one should despise their own flesh and want to be someone else. everyone should feel beautiful and adequate in their own skin, even if it doesn't match their gender expression. I know society makes it hard. but society makes a lot things hard. you're telling me the correct response to that is to mutilate your genitalia? realizing your gender expression does not match your sex characteristics is incredibly traumatic. isn't that a red flag that there is something seriously wrong, psychologically? signed, a citizen who is genuinely concerned about our collective mental health.",David Shepard-Alenko,16,2014-07-12T03:31:03Z

11781,UgiCOn8hT19bzngCoAEC,"Laverne Cox is GORGEOUS in this music video! Probably the most beautiful I've seen her. 

I'm a trans woman and beauty standards that are projected onto women very my\uch effect me. I understand that there are people that will challenge my womanhood regardless of the reality of my life and the things I experience in this world as not only a woman, but a black woman, but I felt the need to tell you that trans women are not exempt from these beauty standards. in fact, I would argue that we face them to a much more severe extent. Our bodies are checked and examined for legitimacy and this is an extent of examination that trans men I'd argue most of the time don't experience this to the same extent. Why? because they're men and while we course have beauty standards for men, these standards very rarely equate to a man's worth. Transitioning makes this very clear and the situations women are placed into rapidly become very clear to any trans woman.



I'd also like to add that there's a difference between transphobia and homophobia. Trans women and gay men are not one in the same. Many trans women are exclusively attracted to women. Gender and sexuality are different.  

I loved this music video on so many levels. Thank you. ",Kat Blaque,1881,2014-07-11T08:22:30Z

It has a representation of all women, regardless of race, body type, style, age, disability, or cis/transsexual orientation, and shows that ALL women are BEAUTIFUL. And it also has such an equal representation of forms of love, whether it be romantic, platonic, familial - love between a man and a woman, love between a woman and a woman, love between sisters, love between friends, love between teammates, even what seems to be love during hardship. This video is truly inspirational and I wish all media would follow in the footsteps of those behind it. It made me cry AND it made me smile and overall it made me feel beautiful and THAT'S what it's all about. 
Thank you, John Legend, and thank you to Mishka Kornai, James Khabushani, Eric Cook, Zac Geoffray, and everyone associated with  #OPERATIONGIRL  that made this happen.
