I recommend you to see 'Try' by Ellie Colbert. I *think* this is the name of the video and the singer.... not sure... I'll correct it later, never mind. 
But you have to see it! 
It's VERY powerful too! 
Just like this one.
Ah, go also take a look at a song called 'Keep ya head up' by a rapper called 2Pac Shakur. Very inspirational too, the lyrics.

No matter how many times I'm told otherwise I don't believe the compliments that I receive, or that the person staring back at me isn't in fact a very large, unattractive woman. In reality, I'm a taller woman wearing a size 6 clothing size down from a 22 at my heaviest. I worked through that without anything other than diet and exercise and should be proud but instead it's just never good enough for me. So huge props to John for putting this masterpiece out there. It gives us all that motivation too stay strong, and believe in more than just our outer shells defining who we are. Sometimes with mental illness and the media it is hard to believe that, and this video does just that for me. Stay positive everyone, and never accept less than what you truly deserve.

892,UghJR27zUAfJQngCoAEC,Nah NopeNopeNope,"@Sierra Solis¬† Breast cancer, bby. When a person gets breast cancer, they do a 'lumpectomy' or a mastectomy where they try to get the cancer out. Sometimes, it's a complete mastectomy, which means they take all the breast tissues out to try to stop the cancer. That woman had a partial mastectomy, which means they cut the cancerous tissue from the breast. It's a really... difficult procedure for a person to go through, because it changes your appearance so much. It's traumatic, or very, very difficult and scary. Some people get breast implants after so they have breasts again, but some people cannot afford that. Some people choose just not to do that, and keep the scars as a reminder that they survived cancer. There's many reasons. I hope this helps you understand.",2014-09-29T09:22:22Z,4

Most of the things that cause men to have low self esteem is also the media telling them they need to be more fit, more manly, which basically is saying it's shameful to look feminine, girly, like a woman.

1123,UghX-eHaGwpBhXgCoAEC,Fals3Agent,"@Tufticles I think you have missed my point - and the point of this video - by a wide margin. Of course this video has something to do with men. It's John Legend, a guy, singing about women and telling them that they are beautiful even if they don't feel the same. So yes, this¬†has everything do¬†with acceptance and being wanted.

I do not appreciate the spin you're putting on this at all.

I could say that women that can't love themselves for who they are is no one else's problem but theirs as well. Yet, that is not what this video is about.

I could also say that¬†a¬†woman¬†doesn't feel accepted and wanted is no one else's problem¬†but theirs too. Yet, this video is here, along with gazillions of others.

So i'm just saying, since there's the XX version of this video, why not have the XY version too? Would that be too much for girl feminists to take?

I can only speak for myself - so I shall. Unlike what you think, I do not judge women based solely on their looks. I've never hurled such mean words to any girl before, and never will.¬†I do not condone violence, and basically anything else that is against the law. I live in a safe country where murders are far and in-between, but feeling judged, unwanted, and unaccepted, and the emotional damage that follows, happen everyday. Consider your attempt at guilty tripping me a failed one.

However, I understand why so many men are hating. I'll try to explain myself. We all know that many women have self-esteem issues and it truly is a problem. Luckily the word is being spread out about it and society is trying to fix this problem. What society doesn't say is that many men also have self-esteem issues, but it doesn't get any attention. It's less know and apparent because men can't express feelings as easily as women. (All of this can be explained if we look at the roles each sex had since the beginning of the human race). So for men who have these self-esteem issues, all the attention women get about those issues can be frustrating. It's sad to say, but it is a lot easier for women to get help regarding those issues.

1223,UghlBHk2HcS0nXgCoAEC,Erin Hand,"First off everyone so far has been ignorant. All European colonization was not at any point raise based. It was based on the fact that one place had resources that they European's wanted or needed. Even all of those European countries were concurred at one point in time by the Romans or Greeks, so if want to blame for the concurring idea blame the ancestry of the Greeks and Italians today. Oh, and guess what, they aren't even pale in complexion, they're bronze toned. It was the Gauls who were pale skinned (aka the Celts and the vikings) both of whom were at some point in time concurred by another. The former Vikings completely lost their culture and way of life and Celtics is almost completely gone and is only practiced daily in rural areas. So no people of darker complexion are the only ones to have been concurred. In fact people of pale coloration have done little of the concurring that has shaped the world we live in today, that would be the Chinese and Spaniards (who are also not pale skinned). Almost all arguments made by coloreds against whites are made out of ignorance. Slavery is also not a hate crime, even our laws say so. Why, because no one enslaved another out of hate. It was a 'you lost the battle/war, sucks for you' scenario. No had a harbored grudge against another. Oh, and guess what, these terrible pale people ¬†who know nothing of enslavement, were one of the longest enslaved people, ranging from the start of the Greek city-states to the end of the Roman Empire.

Unfortunately, I must simply disagree that surgically altering your genitalia is a proper treatment for this pain and confusion. BUT, I still support your right to do it. I support your right to do whatever makes you happy. Your real happiness, identity, and sense of self should not, however, come from you body matching what society has told you your gender expression should be. If your gender is female and your sex is male, or vice versa, that is perfectly fine and okay. No surgery necessary. The work that needs to be done for you to feel whole and find self love/acceptance is on the landscape of your mind, not your body.

Being transgender isn't about hating the skin you're born in, really. Hate sometimes manifests over time, however. It's about simply being born into the wrong body. Your brain is different than what everyone is telling you you are. Imagine yourself, with all your current feelings and affirmations of your gender, but your body looks like a woman's. That doesn't seem right, does it? You feel backwards and confused and everyone is calling you by pronouns that don't feel right and insisting you dress in clothes that feel completely wrong and uncomfortable. It hurts and it's confusing but there are ways to help yourself feel better. Some transgender people do have surgeries, other don't. It's not about mutilation, it's about feeling good about how you look on the outside to match your inside. Gender is entirely a social and psychological construct and it manifests in so many incredible ways and everyone has a right to their own without having hate spat at them. It might be a confusing or difficult concept to grasp but please do yourself a favour and do some research to educate yourself. That's what I've done and I feel like I'm a better person for it.

1407,UghvGMWp6PTXqngCoAEC,Renita Orellana,"@another person¬†I'm not sure who you were addressing this specific response to, since I wasn't the one to bring up rape. In regards to rape, women are often blamed for being raped because they were asking for it. No, they're not at fault for it. But that doesn't mean they can't be blamed for it. Likewise, women and men are taught that women are weak, so women are not held accountable when they rape men. It's a sad double standard.

I would like to clarify that I did not mean to imply that women don't have a hand in perpetuating gender norms that damage all people. Never once did I say that men teach us this or that, I said that we are taught. Often times, we are taught these things by other women, because that's what they were taught to believe is right. This is why we all need to make conscious choices to teach women to be tougher.¬†

I personally don't view myself as solely a victim, I am much more than what has hurt me. I actively acknowledge that women enable negative gender roles, and as I've grown up I've adjusted my lifestyle choices and actions to contribute to this problem as little as possible. Through my interactions with other adults and with my students. I wish more people would do the same.¬†You shouldn't rush to judge people you know nothing about.

1496,Ugi6625MtVksYHgCoAEC,Author Gareth Mayers,"really i would never think that someone would put there actual profession as their you tube name. but i respect you for being proud of your occupation despite some commentators looking down on you, honest work is always respectable. well hear this ill explain the vid there are alot of ways to look at it, but i think you will understand it more this way, in your eyes your girl is the most beautiful women in the world despite what anyone else says about her, society can say she should be this or that but once a real man likes someone he does not care what other think he is going to like what he wants. so the vid is saying that all women are beautiful and that they should know that. its as if john is tell all women what all men think about them. its what you would want to tell you girl and what i would tell mine, that they are beautiful and that we love them no matter what happens, they could lose their hair, breast arms whatever we already love them and its ok do worry about it. which is why the vid ties in so nice with the song. the part where the lady shows her breast listen to what he is saying as it leads up to that point, o man its beautiful. she does not have to try. ¬†you get it",2014-07-12T15:10:48Z,0
